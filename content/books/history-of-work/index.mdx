One of my very kind brothers bought this for me as a birthday gift.  
It was a great pick â€“ the anthropology of work is one of my eternal obsessions.  
[David Graeber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Graeber) was my gateway drug into thinking about the very strange and bemusing cultural beliefs we construct around money, value, morality, obligation, employment, and salaries.  
While no one writes quite like Graeber, I was thrilled to hear another anthropologist had written a fat new book looking at the long historical arc of labour through a cultural lens. I'm hoping Suzman tackles such a vast topic with the right balance of detailed research and accessible summarising it needs.

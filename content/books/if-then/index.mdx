I heard about this book through an event [Data & Society](https://datasociety.net/library/jill-lepore-discusses-if-then-with-danah-boyd/) held with Jill Lepore and [danah boyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danah_boyd). As an unashamed danah boyd fangirl, I pay attention to anything danah says is worth paying attention to. I'd been meaning to dig into Jill Lepore's work for a while. I have a number of intense history nerds in my family who love her writing. I've also had a copy of one of Jill's other books sitting on my shelf for too long; [The Mansion of Happiness](https://www.librarything.com/work/12474293): A History of Life and Death (still unread).   
Once I saw it was a social and historical investigation of how we ended up in our current data surveillance dystopia, it was an easy instabuy.

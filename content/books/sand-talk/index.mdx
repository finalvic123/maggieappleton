This book made the rounds in my mother's community of international librarians. They spend a lot of time working on initiatives to diversify library collections, and bring in the voices of marginalised perspectives. She assured me I'd love it, and she was right.

</ReadingContext>

At first I was put off by the trite subtitle. Anytime a book title promises to _save the world_, _change your life_, or _make you question everything_, it's safe to assume an patronising publisher came up with it. No author is egotistical enough to write that sort of hyperbole.

Questionable subtitles aside, Tyson's writing felt unpretentious, humble, and bitingly funny.

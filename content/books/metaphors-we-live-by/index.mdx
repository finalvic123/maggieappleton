Metaphors are not a neat storytelling trick or variety of linguistic flourish. They're the foundation of all human thought and reasoning â€“ the invisible structure holding up our mental world that affects everything we think, say, and do. 

This idea is known as **Cognitive Metaphor theory**, and was pioneered by cognitive scientists George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in this 1980 book.

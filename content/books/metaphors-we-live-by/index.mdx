Metaphors are not a neat storytelling trick or variety of linguistic flourish. They're the foundation of all human thought and reasoning â€“ the invisible structure holding up our mental world that affects everything we think, say, and do. 

This idea is known as Cognitive Metaphor theory, and was pioneered by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in their book Metaphors We Live By.
All human thought is fundamentally metaphorical. Metaphors structure the way we think, and therefore everything we say and do.

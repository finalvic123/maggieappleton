Over the course of 2020 I become increasingly enamoured with <a href="https://oxfordre.com/anthropology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190854584.001.0001/acrefore-9780190854584-e-7">Design Anthropology</a>, a field focused on using anthropological research techniques and insights to guide the design process. Adam Drazin, one of the professors of anthropology at UCL, suggested I look into the work of <a href="http://dunneandraby.co.uk/content/biography">Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby</a>. The pair led the well-regarded Interaction Design programme at the Royal College of Art up until 2015. Their approach intrigued me because it's not the standard "futurologist" idea of casting predictions with "weak signals," but instead a playful, open-ended, generative invitation to take cultural imagination seriously.

Dunne and Raby argue that in our current moment, dreams of the future have been downgraded to mere survival. The current prospects of the climate crisis make it difficult to imagine positive outcomes and alternative lives.

> "Dreams are powerful. They are repositories of our desire. They animate
the entertainment industry and drive consumption. They can blind
people to reality and provide cover for political horror. But they can also inspire us to imagine that things could be radically different than they are today, and then believe we can progress toward that
imaginary world"

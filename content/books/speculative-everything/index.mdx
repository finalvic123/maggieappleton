Over the course of 2020 I become increasingly enamoured with <a href="https://oxfordre.com/anthropology/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190854584.001.0001/acrefore-9780190854584-e-7">Design Anthropology</a>, a field focused on using anthropological research techniques and insights to guide the design process. Adam Drazin, one of the professors of anthropology at UCL, suggested I look into the work of <a href="http://dunneandraby.co.uk/content/biography">Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby</a>. The pair led the well-regarded Interaction Design programme at the Royal College of Art up until 2015. Their approach intrigued me because it's not the standard "futurologist" idea of casting predictions with "weak signals," but instead a playful, open-ended, generative invitation to take cultural imagination seriously.

Dunne and Raby argue that in the current moment, our dreams of the future have been downgraded to mere survival. The current prospects of the climate crisis make it difficult to imagine positive outcomes and alternative lives.

_"Dreams are powerful. They are repositories of our desire. They animate the entertainment industry and drive consumption. They can blind people to reality and provide cover for political horror. But they can also inspire us to imagine that things could be radically different than they are today, and then believe we can progress toward that imaginary world"_

People often think design is about solving problems, or simply crafting visual aesthetics â€“ making logos and Bauhaus posters. Designers themselves carry an "inherent optimism" about their ability to fix problems and are often overly concerned with dreaming up material solutions. They should instead address the values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviour that lead to Wicked Problems - ones we cannot fix with 'innovative' gadgets.

Dunne and Raby suggest we should use design "as a means of speculating how things could be." Speculative Design aims to create space for discussion, and explore alternative ways of being - "a catalyst for redefining our relationship to reality."

This all sounds to me like it would jive well with Tim Ingold's hopes the future of anthropology in [Anthropology: Why It Matters](/anthropology-matters).
__The point of anthropology is to expand people's awareness of what human culture makes possible.__

Most Futurism & Futurology work tries to pin down the future by identifying trends and weak signals, then extrapolating on them into your prototypical map of The Futures Cone.

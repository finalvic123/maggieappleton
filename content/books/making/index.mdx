While studying among the Saami in Finland, Tim was taught to only way to know things is through a process of self-discovery. Formal instruction is only a pretence of true knowing, as becomes apparent the minute you try to actually __do__ something

"To know things you have to grow into them, and let them grow in you, so that they become a part of who you are"
It's through embodied watched, listening, feeling, a "process of active following, of __going along__". "By paying attention to what the world has to tell us"
The Saami are fishers, hunters, and herders - for them you don't learn __through__ movement. Knowing __is__ movement.

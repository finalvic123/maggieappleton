[Paul Dourish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dourish) takes us on a historical and philosophical exploration of how we interact with machines, and how our evolving understanding of embodied cognition is changing how we think about designing digital interfaces.

I first came across Dourish's work through his writings on [digital materiality](https://www.librarything.com/work/19893504), and his research on Ubiquitous Computing in [Divining a Digital Future](/diving-digital-future) with Geneieve Bell.

As I began reading more of the foundational literature around [Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) this year, I was surprised to see him pop up again. This book appears to be one of the modern classics of the field.

## A History of Interaction design

Our notion of what a computer is, what it does, and how it works hasn't changed for decades.

We're still living with the legacy of a trade off made fifty years ago; computer processing time used to be enormously expensive, and it was worth making humans transform their data and instructions into formal, rigid input languages that optimised for the machine experience â€“ rather than for the human experience. At the time, most computers were used for military or business calculations and no one minded too much.

We now have the odd contradiction that our machines have enormous power we never fully leverage - 95% of the time they're doing basic tasks at low computational capacity.

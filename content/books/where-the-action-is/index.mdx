[Paul Dourish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dourish) takes us on a historical and philosophical exploration of how we interact with machines, and how our evolving understanding of embodied cognition is changing how we think about designing digital interfaces.

I first came across Dourish's work through his writings on [digital materiality](https://www.librarything.com/work/19893504), and his research on Ubiquitous Computing in [Divining a Digital Future](/diving-digital-future) with Geneieve Bell.

As I began reading more of the foundational literature around [Human-Computer Interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human%E2%80%93computer_interaction) this year, I was surprised to see him pop up again. This book appears to be one of the modern classics of the field. Written in 2001, it holds up as a highly relevant and insightful exploration of how we should design computers that align with our embodied knowledge of the world.

## A History of Interaction design

Our notion of what a computer is, what it does, and how it works hasn't changed for decades.

We're still living with the legacy of a trade off made fifty years ago; computer processing time used to be enormously expensive. It was worth making humans transform their data and instructions into formal, rigid input languages that optimised for the machine's experience, rather than for the human experience. At the time, most computers were used for military or business calculations and no one minded too much.

We now have the odd contradiction that our machines have more power than we're able to leverage - 95% of the time they're doing basic tasks at low computational capacity. While we perch in front of them slowly deciding what we want to do next.

We're stuck in the historical paradigm of 'desktop computing' â€“ the idea computers are a static workstation we plop in the corner of the room, and go to in order to execute specific tasks that occupy the whole of our attention.

The dream of Ubiquitous Computing tries to subvert this notion. Ubicomp is a paradigm of computing where our machines are embedded in everything around us. The point is to get us up and moving around in the world, and bring the computational power with us.

This was what we were promised with the 'internet of things,' which has so far turned out to be the internet of impractical, invasive surveillance objects.

Research institutes like [Dynamicland](https://dynamicland.org/) are reportedly exploring the idea of 'the room as a computer', but it all still seems like a  hypothetical prototype.

Dourish proposes the concept of **Embodied Interaction**

"Embodied Interaction is interaction with computer systems that occupy our world, a world of physical and social reality, and that exploit this fact in how they interact with us." (3)

Traditionally, computational systems are thought of as procedures - step by step models of sequential behaviour. The last two decades have seen us turn towards interaction. We are instead paying attention to the interplay of different components. An ecosystem of interlinked elements instead of a rote sequence of tasks.

The system focuses on many diverse elements with specific roles rather than generalised monolithic processes.

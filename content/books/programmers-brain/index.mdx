This book is still in early release, but the preview version is already promising.  
I picked up it as background research for a long-term project I've been working on with <a href="https://overreacted.io/">Dan Abramov</a> called <a href="https://justjavascript.com/">Just JavaScript</a>. It's an interactive book where we're diagramming the mental models of JavaScript to help improve people's understanding of how the language works. Dan found Felienne's research on teaching programming systems and we're using her insights to help develop further course material.

Kathy Sierra is a badass.

Truly immersive, transformative experiences like rock climbing, snowboarding, deep coding problems take people into another world. It's the [[Flow]] from Mihael Cic------ski. In game design they call it **The Magic Circle**

We can craft extraordinary worlds for our users in very simple ways â€“ worlds that __transport them__ to flow state, alternative places

**Cognitive Leaks** - Anything that drains our cognitive resources in the user experience is a problem. Don't make users think more than they already have to.

More buttons, more options, more things we have to think through are cognitive overhead for users.
[[Don Norman]] and the [[Design of Everyday Things]] popularised the idea of **Knowledge in the World** vs. **Knowledge in the Head**. We want to use the knowledge in the head to our advantage, and make products intuitive based on what people already know. 

Knowledge "in the world" is when there's an instruction manual you have to read, 3 different models, and 20 settings menus.

"Death by a thousand cognitive microleaps" add up in a person's life. They don't want to think about your 20 setting menus. They want to make lunch and pick up their kid on time and fix their programming bug and have time to read tonight.

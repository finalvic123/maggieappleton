> "Anthropology, in my definition, is philosophy with the people in"

"Taking others seriously is the first rule of my kind of anthropology"

"[The role of anthropology is] to temper the knowledge bequeathed by science with the wisdom of experience and imagination. The more we take refuge in the citadels of knowledge, the less attention we pay to what is going on around us."

"Human worlds, we insist, are culturally constructed – except, of course, our own, since, bathed in the light of reason, we can see what they cannot, namely that these diverse constructions are but alternative fabrications of a given reality. Their view is suspended in a web of meaning, ours is grounded in objective fact. We are spectators in the gallery of human variation; they are the portraits. We can see in, they can’t see out"

As an undergraduate Tim felt disillusioned by both the arrogant godly dominance of the natural sciences, and the esoteric impracticality of the humanities. The widening gap brown the two felt like "the great tragedy of the intellectual history of the West"
Anthropology felt like the rightful reunion of the two sides - attempting to "reunite the human being with being human, yet in a way that never loses sight of lived experience"

Anthropology's original ambition was to forge "a unified science of man". In many ways this fell apart and requires we "rebuild anthropology for the future"

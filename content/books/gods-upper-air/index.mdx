A historical account of how anthropologist [Franz Boas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas) and his students [Margaret Mead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Mead), [Ruth Benedict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruth_Benedict), [Ella Deloria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ella_Cara_Deloria), and [Zora Neale Hurston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zora_Neale_Hurston) overturned our assumptions about gender, race, and sex through their work.

Boas and his students _invented_ the term **Cultural Anthropology** and the notion of Cultural Relativism - which still today gets cast as some over-politically-correct postmodernist nonsense.

The critics' issue with Cultural Relativism is that it undermines the notion of _"objectivity"_  - "How can we make any judgements about right and wrong, critics ask, if everything is relative to the time, place, and context in which the judgement occurs?"  (8)  
Which is precisely the point.

The Boas circle weren't skeptical about our ability to know reality, or the value of The Scientific Method. Simply that cultures needed to be understood on their own terms, from a place of deep understanding.

Boas and his circle of students were living in the United States in the first half of the 20th Century - a nation that **"proclaimed its origins in enlightened values but perfected a vast system of racial disenfranchisement."** (8)

The national narrative insisted "on the universal applicability of their idea of a good society". Hence, _[Manifest Destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny)_.

"The belief that our ways are the only commonsensical, moral one has a powerful allure, especially when expressed in the language of science, rationality, religion, or tradition" (8)

The Boas circle undermined the reigning presumption that cultural development mirrored biological evolution - that societies "progressed" from less complex to more complex.

> "Culture, as Boas and his students understood it, is the ultimate source for what we think constitutes common sense. It defines what is obvious or beyond question." (9)

"The essential messsage of the Boas circle was that we are all museum pieces. We have our own taboos and totems, our own gods and demons. Since these things are largely our own creations, the choice rests with us to venerate or exorcise them" (12)

Boas had the critical insight that supposedly Objective scientific data "was relative to the worldview, skill sets, and pre-existing categories of the researchers themselves. All science is provisional" (71)

## The Historical Context of Franz Boas

Franz Boas came from fairly wealthy circumstances in mid-19th Century Germany. University-educated, his father funded his early exploratory adventures to **Baffin Island** where he lived with an Inuit community documenting their culture. Essentially the first instances of Fieldwork and the beginnings of Participant Observation

Moved to the United States in 1885, and began getting into debates with Armchair Anthropologists writing comparative texts from the comfort of Oxford.

Took on academics like Edward Tyler Burnett and James Frazer (author of The Golden Bough) debating how we should do comparative studies of human cultures.

At this point "anthropology" was primarily thought of as Biological Anthropology, Archeology, Linguistics, and museum curation. There was a lot of skull-measuring going on to categorise people according to physical characteristics.

There was a specific preoccupation with trying to draw correlations between cranial features, facial angles, and patterns of behaviour. "Using systematic observation of the outward traits of individuals to arrive at conclusions about the apparent differences across social groups" (66)

Boas befriended Grant Stanley Hall, one of the original pioneers of the field of Psychology. Hall was setting up the brand new Clark University in Massachusetts, and appointed Boas to a lecturer position in Anthropology - despite it not being an established subject yet.

He moved to Chicago in time for the Chicago World's Fair in 1893, held to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' arrival in the New World in 1492. Anthropologists saw it as a chance to "define itself as a coherent field of knowledge" (62)

Franz Boas helped found the American Anthropological Association, and its official publication American Anthropologist.

## The Concept of Race in the 18th-20th Century

Throughout the 18th Century and 19th Century, it was taken for granted that humans came in a set of "natural" categories - distinct __races__. Discernible through a series of physical characteristics and behaviour traits. The same way dogs come in breeds.

Johann Blumenbach, a German anatomist, defined the initial finite set; Ethiopians, American, Mongolians, Malay, and Caucasians. Others built off this speculating on certain sub-races and species.
 
 Madison Grant, an American with a particular fondness for Eugenics, wrote a book called "**The Passing of the Great Race** in 1916. It was enormously popular at the time, and "hailed as a milestone in the application of scientific ideas to history and public policy." The book argued the United States needed to maintain "racial fitness," and was going to hell in a hand basket because "White Nordic Americans" were being outnumbered by supposedly inferior races.
 
 Franz Boas initially received funding to go out and measure how well certain 'races' were assimilating into the great American melting pot. His graduate students spread across Chicago measuring skulls, noses, eye colours, and scales.
 
 After thousands of measurements, it turned out there was no such thing as a "jew," "pole," or "slovak," in purely physical terms. "The conditions of life, from diet to environment, were having a quick and measurable effect on head forms that were thought to be fixed, inheritable, and indicative of one's essential type."
 
 Boas and his students had to conclude races were not a stable, objective reality, but rather a socially-constructed and wildly variable concept.

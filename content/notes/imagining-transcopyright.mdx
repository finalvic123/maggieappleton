<IntroParagraph>

In 1965, [Ted Nelson]() imagined a system of interactive text where words would be freed from the constraints of paper documents. This _hypertext_ would be linkable and interactive. Thirty years later, Tim Berners Lee would [take inspiration]() from Nelson's vision and other narratives like Vannevar Bush's [Memex]() to create the world wide web. Hypertext came to life.

</IntroParagraph>

But hypertext - and it's key feature of hyperlinking - was only one small concept amidst a sea of ideas Nelson spent his life developing, most of them entwined in his grand vision of [Project Xanadu]() – a global hypertext project intended to transform the way we connect knowledge. Xanadu is often framed as an alternative to the web – "the web that could have been" – if it had ever shipped. Which it didn't.

Despite the fact we're not currently browsing the Xanadu web, Nelson is still full of provocative, insightful ideas that have yet to come to fruition – ones that address many of the issues currently plaguing the modern web.

Two of the most intruiging are **Transclusion** and **Transcopyright**, a pair of concepts that reimagine the way authorship, attribution, copyright, and content monetization might work online.

## Transclusion



## Transcopyright


## Speculative Interfaces

My immediate reaction to this conceptual pair was to try and grasp onto a more grounded version of it.

What would this look like in a real interface? What kind of visual representations and interactions would make this possible?

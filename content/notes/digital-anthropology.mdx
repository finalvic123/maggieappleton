<IntroParagraph>

Eight years ago, one of my undergraduate professors handed me the book [Addiction by Design](/addiction-by-design) by [Natasha Dow Schull](https://www.natashadowschull.org/). It's a gorgeous ethnographic tale of gambling machines and the people addicted to them.

It's more than a voyeuristic insight into people who sit at slot machines for 48 hours straight though. The garish floors of Las Vegas casinos become a venue to explore our embodied relationships with machines, the nature of technological dependence, and the potential hazards of mixing algorithmic systems with Capitalist incentives.

</IntroParagraph>

The book was my gateway drug into the field of __digital anthropology__ (also known as _[cyborg anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_anthropology)_ back then), as well as its sister discipline [Science and Technology Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies) (STS).

I fell for it hard. The way everyone falls for big, intoxicating ideas at twenty-one. Like Marxism or Foucauldian Power or Quantum String Theory. But unlike my other intellectual flings, this one stuck with me.

It's now the autumn of 2020, and I've just begun an MSc in Digital Anthropology at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc). 

Which means I'm being asked the question "so... what _is_ digital anthropology?" far more frequently.

## What is 'Digital Anthropology'?

Forgive the obviousness of this, but like it says on the tin, it's the intersection of _cultural anthropology_ and  _digital things_.

Let's break those two down, because they're both are open to generous interpretation.

<br />

#### _Cultural anthropology_ is the study of human culture – our narratives, symbols, rituals, habits, beleifs and norms. 

Or as [Clifford Geertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Geertz) put it, it's all the webs of meaning and significance we spin for ourselves <Footnote id={1}>If you'd like more insightful writings on the nature of culture, Geertz's [The Interpreation of Cultures](/interpretation-cultures) is an essential read</Footnote>.

That might sound pointlessly generic. Plenty of disciplines study culture – sociologists, historians, and psychologists among them.  

What defines Anthropologists is that we study culture through **participant observation**  <Footnote id={2}>Anthropologists use all manner of other methods too – surveys, data collection, interviews, mapping, and historical research. But active participant observation is at the heart of the discipline</Footnote>
– the act of completely immersing yourself in another culture for a long period of time as both an active _participant_ in it, and _an observer_ of it. You join in the dance, and then analyse what the dance means.

Essentially, we study culture at an "on the ground" level – looking for the rich details, particular nuances, and [thick description](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thick_description) you can only find by being with people in their daily lives, rather than pointing a telescope at them from afar, or scraping large databases of things they've posted to Reddit.

That's enough about Anthropology. If you want to know more, Tim Ingold's [Anthropology: Why It Matters](/anthropology-matters) is a short but beautiful introduction.

#### By _digital things_ I mean objects and systems based on binary logic – the 1's and 0's that run all of modern computing.

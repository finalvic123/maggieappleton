### "Who was the first digital gardener and what were they planting?"

Back in April I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where 
there was something culturally compelling about this concept.

Tracing back how a <Link to="/neologisms">Neologisms</Link> is born is always a wonderfully fascinating inquiry. The term had been floating around for quite a while, but went through a number of semantic shifts and relative meanings.



{current definition}



The most comprehensive and true-to-form original manifesto of this understand of "Digital Gardening" has to be Mark Bernstein's 1998 <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> essay.

It's the earliest mention I can find anywhere on the web.

It's first mention on Twitter was April 2007, right when the platform was itself beginning to grow. Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) defined it as _"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"_ <Footnote count={1}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, "faffing" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>

The first dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment â€“ people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **cleaning up one's digital space**.  

The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating.

Back in April I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where 
there was something culturally compelling about this concept.

Tracing back how a <Link to="/neologisms">Neologism</Link> is born is always a wonderfully fascinating inquiry. The term has been floating around for over two decades, but went through a handful of semantic shifts along the way.

Let's first figure out what we __think__ it means here and now.

## The History

Fittingly, the earliest mention of digital gardening I've found aligns with the way were currently using it. Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> is a  true-to-form original manifesto.

Its first mention on Twitter was April 2007, right when the platform was itself beginning to grow. Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) defined it as _"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"_ <Footnote count={1}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, "faffing" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>

The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment â€“ people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **cleaning up one's digital space**.  

The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating.

Tim Ingold on making as growth, not turning ideas into matter. Being in conversation with the world.

Formal instruction is only a pretence of true knowing, as becomes apparent the minute you try to actually do something." />

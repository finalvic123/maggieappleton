Back in April I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little attention, and made clear there was something culturally compelling about this concept.

The term had been floating around for a while.

Tracing back how a cultural term emerges is always a wonderfully fascinating inquiry. The history here is dappled. 

It's first mention on Twitter was April 2007, right when the platform was itself beginning to grow.

Rory Sutherland – coincidentally, the vice president of Ogilvy Group – defined it as __"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"__

The first dozen mentions on Twitter all used the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **cleaning up one's digital space**.  
The focus was on _weeding_, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating.

The most comprehensive and true-to-form original manifesto of the digital garden has to be Mark Bernstein's <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> essay.

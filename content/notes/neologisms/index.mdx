#### Brahmin Left

"The “left” has become the party of the intellectual elite (Brahmin left), while the “right” can be viewed as the party of the business elite (Merchant right). In India’s traditional caste system, upper castes were divided into Brahmins (priests, intellectuals) and Kshatryas/Vaishyas (warriors, merchants, tradesmen). To some extent the modern political conflict seems to follow this division." - <a to="http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Piketty2018.pdf">Thomas Piketty </a>

#### Pinkering

Named for Steven Pinker - a common phenomenon among do-gooder elites who cite the long arc of human history in order to downplay and minimise any immediate suffering.

Another variety is _Economic Pinkering_ which justifies any economic concerns by simply citing how many Chinese people have been lifted into the middle class.

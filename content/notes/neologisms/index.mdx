A collection of all my favourite Neologisms

#### Brahmin Left

"The “left” has become the party of the intellectual elite (Brahmin left), while the “right” can be viewed as the party of the business elite (Merchant right). In India’s traditional caste system, upper castes were divided into Brahmins (priests, intellectuals) and Kshatryas/Vaishyas (warriors, merchants, tradesmen). To some extent the modern political conflict seems to follow this division." - <TooltipLink to="http://piketty.pse.ens.fr/files/Piketty2018.pdf">Thomas Piketty </TooltipLink>

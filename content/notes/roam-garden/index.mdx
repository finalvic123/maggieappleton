Just like any good seventeenth century English garden, this one has two sides to it – the private and the public.

Everything I post here first sprouts in my [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) garden.


If you have never heard of Roam, first stop by Anne-Laure LeCunff's articles on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research">Roam for Metacognition</a>, and the more hands-on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-beginner-guide">The Beginner’s Guide to Roam</a>.

The TLDR is that it's a note-taking tool designed around  <Link to="/bidirectionals">Bi-Directional Links</Link>

Thanks to the thriving <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult">#roamcult</a> community, building and tending my Roam space has become a glorious exercise in knowledge management, experimental workflows, and collective problem solving.

Seeing the wide diversity of systems Roamers build is the whole point. It's a grand communal experiment.

<p><a href="https://www.influenceinsights.io/">Robert Haisfield</a> has started hosting a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWA6aNcUjK2w0Z_-0UURq_g/videos">Roam video tours</a> where Roamers walk through their databases showing all the ways they've adapted the system to their particular needs.</p>

This is essentially a COVID-friendly version of MTV Cribs for personal knowledge management nerds. Conspicuous consumption in the age of sense-making knowledge work.

After posting too much on Twitter about my extensive <Link to="/painting-roam">Roam CSS style system</Link>, I got chatting to Rob and ended up doing one of these digital-hipster crib tours.

Forgive the mess in the kitchen...

Here's a few of the workflows and techniques I covered with Rob. These are essentially a collection of __Design Patterns__ for personal knowledge management.

They're not "mine," but instead a remixed mashup influenced by Andy Matuschak, Malcolm Ocean, Tiago Forte, Nat Eliason, Joel Chan, and many other Roam-esque-thinkers (not all of whom even use Roam). <Footnote count={1}>See my illustrated<Link to="/basb">Building a Second Brain Notes</Link> for more on Tiago's system in particular</Footnote>

Just like any good seventeenth century English garden, this one has two sides to it – the private and the public.

Everything I post here first sprouts in my [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com) garden. 

<ImageFrame alt="A screen capture of my system in Roam" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1720/v1590188713/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam_theme_maggie.png" />

If you have never heard of Roam, first stop by Anne-Laure LeCunff's articles on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research">Roam for Metacognition</a>, and the more hands-on <a href="https://nesslabs.com/roam-research-beginner-guide">The Beginner’s Guide to Roam</a>.
 
Otherwise the rest of this post will be completely bewildering.

Thanks to the thriving <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult">#roamcult</a> community, building and tending my Roam space has become a glorious exercise in knowledge management, experimental workflows, and collective problem solving. 

> There is no *one way* to use Roam. 

Seeing the wide diversity of systems Roamers build is the whole point. It's a grand communal experiment.

<p><a href="https://www.influenceinsights.io/">Robert Haisfield</a> has started hosting a series of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWA6aNcUjK2w0Z_-0UURq_g/videos">Roam video tours</a> where Roamers walk through their databases showing all the ways they've adapted the system to their particular needs.</p>

This is essentially a COVID-friendly version of MTV Cribs for personal knowledge management nerds. Conspicuous consumption in the age of sense-making knowledge work.

<p>After posting too much on Twitter about my extensive <Link to="/painting-roam">Roam CSS styling system</Link>, I got chatting to Rob and ended up doing one of these digital-hipster crib tours.</p>

We had a wonderfully wide-ranging chat on note taxonomies, spaced repetition, the limitations of text-based thought.

Enjoy, and forgive the mess in the kitchen...

## Patterns of Roam

<p>Here's a few of the workflows and techniques I covered with Rob.<br/> These are essentially a collection of <b>Design Patterns</b> for personal knowledge management.</p>

<p>They're not "mine," but instead a remixed mashup influenced by Andy Matuschak, Malcolm Ocean, Tiago Forte<Footnote count={2}>See my illustrated <Link to="/basb">Building a Second Brain Notes</Link> for more on Tiago's system in particular</Footnote>, Nat Eliason, Joel Chan, and many other Roam-esque-thinkers  
(not all of whom even use Roam).</p>

### Note Taxonomy

A map of my taxonomical landscape.


### Keyboard Maestro

Roam is obviously part of my larger digital ecosystem. And <a href="">Keyboard Maestro</a> is a seasoning that goes well with anything.

### The Flow of Information

I like keeping an **open stream** that runs from source material, through Roam, and up into this digital garden.

This open stream means the reading, note-taking, reflecting, developing ideas, and publishing process is a continuous repeating cycle. Not a linear pipeline.

Instead of reading the whole book. Then importing the notes. Then reflecting on them and crafting a summary. Then uploading the "finished piece" to the internet, I instead do all of those at once. _In very small chunks._

Especially for books that I want to go deep on, it allows me to take my sweet time.

Let's take a book I'm currently reading, <Link to="making-anthropology">Making by Time Ingold</Link>.    
My stream of notes on it currently live in three places all at once.

First, <a href="https://getdrafts.com/">Drafts</a> app is where I capture book notes when I'm away from my desk (Roam's quick capture feature isn't its strong suit).

<Image src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590778121/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/bookflow_1.png" />

It's nice and simple, and always perfectly syncs between my iOS devices and the desktop app.

I read on my phone (because I'm an awful person). While out walking around (because I'm a truly awful person). Or in the evening on my iPad. All my books are PDFs and I use <a href="https://pdfexpert.com/">PDF Expert</a> solely for it's 'reading mode' feature. It's seamless to switch between the two as I read and make notes.

Every few days I transfer Drafts notes into Roam. This gives me the chance to link up related concepts, bold key points, highlight _really key_  points, and start collecting Evergreen Notes & Key Concepts at the top of my note.

I've also become a convert to the church of __Taking Notes in Your Own Words__.  I still copy and paste key quotes, but I try to rephrase and rewrite ideas in my own terms as much as possible. Doing this just makes synthesising so much easier and faster. It also helps me think. Which is the point of this entire note-taking carnival.

As my Roam notes develop, I transfer chunks of them over to my public notes on the book <Link to="making-anthropology">which you can read here</Link>. You will notice they're fairly loose. Every time I add more notes onto the end I lightly clean up the earlier sections and update the "last tended" date.

The idea is that by the time I finish the book, I've already done the majority of my thinking, reflecting, writing, and synthesising on it. And created a readable summary n+1 other people might find helpful.

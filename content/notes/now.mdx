- Researching [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] and [[Pattern Languages]] for ad-hoc learning groups and reading collectives. Heavily inspired by the principles laid out in the [[The Knowledge Hydrant]], and seeking ways to expand on them.
- Applying said research to new learning models at [egghead](https://egghead.io/). We're experimenting with **Knowledge Adventure Clubs** and **Cascading Book Groups** based around [[Understanding by Design]] principles.
- Enthusiastically preparing to start a part-time Masters degree in [Digital Anthropology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc) at UCL in September (yes... probably on Zoom)

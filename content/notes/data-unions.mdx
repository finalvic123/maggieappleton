<IntroParagraph>

At the end of last year I got to attend <a href="https://medium.com/mozilla-festival/tagged/mozfest2019">MozFest</a> here in London. Mozilla events are consistently extraordinarily in their format and coordination level. It's a  thousand-person unconference that actually works.

</IntroParagraph>

The only issue is immense FOMO as you try to pick between attending a roundtable discussion on gendered voice assistants, a panel on _The Algorithmic Gaze_, or a debate on  _The Future of Disinformation_. You can browse through the overwhelming variety of sessions they ran <a href="https://public.zenkit.com/c/2RH604FcHf/schedule?v=LK9b3laIX&hide=workspaceLists">here.</a>

One of my favourite sessions was on **Data Unions and the Future of Data** with speakers from <a href="https://streamr.network/">Streamr</a> and the <a href="https://theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a>

<p>I hadn't encountered the concepts of <a href="https://medium.com/streamrblog/what-are-data-unions-how-do-they-work-which-ones-can-i-use-887e67fb7716">Data Unions</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@anoukruhaak/data-trusts-why-what-and-how-a8b53b53d34">Data Trusts</a> before. While we're all acutely aware of the current economic-internet-clusterfuck where we seem to pay nothing for services, and invisibly hand over valuable data, you don't often hear reasonable solutions to the problem.</p>

<p>Other than some vague mumblings about blockchain that are swiftly followed up with an offer to buy into an ICO...</p>

<p>I sketched out some notes during the session which should give you a general idea of the model. I can't speak to any of the technical aspects or feasibility of this, but the concept is intriguing.</p>

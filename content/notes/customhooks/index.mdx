<p>Last year the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">React</a> team released a feature called "hooks" that lets you do some powerful stuff we couldn't do as easily before... <br />Managing state. <br />Accessing DOM elements. <br />Using side effects.</p>

<br/>

<p>It's fair to say the React community had a collective melt-down over this. For the better part of 2019, hooks turned into an all-encompassing obsession.</p>

<p>Hooks came with a bunch of pre-made options, but also allowed you to remix the default options to create <b>custom hooks</b></p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jsjoeio/">Joe Previte</a> made a whole egghead course on <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/shareable-custom-hooks-in-react/">Shareable Custom Hooks in React</a>. While working through the material I made a set of illustrated notes on the main ideas</p>

I've made plenty of illustrated notes for egghead courses.  
On everything from <a href="/customhooks">custom React Hooks</a> to <a href="/gitmistakes">Git workflows</a> to <a href="rust">the basics of Rust</a>

They've always been artefacts made in post-production.  
I draw them after the course has already been planned, and the videos are all recorded.  

This year I started experimenting with a more collaborative approach – one that directly involves our course instructors.

Rather than treating our illustrations as a shiny course add-on made by one person, I wanted to integrate them into the planning and design stages.  
A thinking tool instead of a performative medium.

I may know a few things about how to visually explain ideas, but I usually know _next to nothing_ about the topic of any given course.

There are some advantages to this.  Beginners mind is a beautiful thing.

But it has it's limitations.  Because in order to visually explain something _well_, you need to truly understand it.  

When we draw there are no vague relationships or fuzzy edges.  
You have to make clear how all the parts of a system are related.  
What's above and below. What's a container and what's a substance.  
What actions and events are happening between elements.

It requires a nuanced understanding of the material.  
My beginners notes are still useful but they fall short in lots of ways.  
I make mistakes. I skim the surface of material. I can't dive deep on technical details.  

These flaws were frustrating.

So I started running visual workshopping sessions – pairing up with instructors while they were still in the middle of making a course and collaborating on visual explanations.

We hop on a Zoom call and open up a shared canvas in <a href="">Miro</a> or <a href="">Excalidraw</a>.
We pick out a few of the toughest concepts, and begin making extremely rough diagrams. Experimental ugliness is the whole point.

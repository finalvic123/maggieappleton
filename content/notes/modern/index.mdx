Latour's theories launched the discipline of Science and Technology Studies and forced us all to completely rethink the age old debate between objective and subjective realities. Science and Technology Studies  does not make hard scientific facts entirely a social construction. It simply makes visible the otherwise completely ignored layer of culture in their creation. Latour's work is mostly concerned with drawing attention to the invisible structures of the modern constitution. And to question it. Though he's often read as a strong social constructivist or a postmodernist denying reality, and he lamented it. 

Latours theory of resistance is that there is such a thing as a social object. And such a thing as a natural object. And almost everything is a hybrid of the two. Hard facts are "resistant" to being changed by humans cultural ideas. He a realist - he believes in a reality that's "resistant" to the human understanding of the world that is socially made. Argues that scientific objects are hybrid constructions of human and non human, nature and culture. The product of social systems and politics and laboratory culture.

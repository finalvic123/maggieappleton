<IntroParagraph>

Setting up your own [[Digital Garden]] can be a pretty technical affair. <Footnote idName={1}>If you're new to the idea of digital gardening I suggest you read my essay on the [history and ethos](/garden-history) of it first.</Footnote> Up until recently, the options for folks who don't already know how to build a website with modern front-end frameworks were limited. 

</IntroParagraph>

All of the early digital gardens were built by web developers, simply because the idea was new, and we had the ability to roll our own solutions. But the idea of treating your personal website like a  garden is [spreading](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/), and lots of non-technical people are looking for ways to cultivate their own corner of the web. <Footnote idName={2}>I want to acknowledge calling anyone  _non-technical_ is controversial, since it suggests some people are inherently unable to code or wade through complex digital tools. I obviously don't believe that's the case, but want to recognise some folks feel less confident and comfortable with digital systems than others.</Footnote> There's a clear need for digital gardening tools and platforms that don't require you to write JavaScript, configure a DNS setup, or understand how to clone a GitHub repo via the command line.

Dozens of people have messaged me asking how they can get started building a garden if they don't know how to code. I used to point them to my Github collection of [digital gardening tools](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), but mumble apologies because most of the solutions listed there require a reasonably high level of technical literacy.

I hated telling these folks I didn't know how to help them. 

Thankfully, that's starting to change. Over the last six months, a number of tools have popped up that make it _much_ easier to plant a digital garden without touching code.

## Gardening with Notion

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is by far my top pick for building a digital garden when you're not code-savvy.

Notion claims it's a note-taking app for teams ‚Äì a shared space for documentation and planning. Which it is. However, it's also secretly one of the best tools for building no-code websites. 

It's essentially a nicely presented Google Doc with a bunch of fancy features built on top. You write markdown in a simple text file, but can also add images, create column-based layouts, embed links, and build tables in the middle of it. You can create pages inside other pages and easily navigate between them.

The killer feature we care about here is the "Share to Web" button. You can create a Notion document and publish it to a link on the web. You now essentially have a website without needing to worry about hosting, domains, web frameworks, or CMS's. üëè Slow üëè Clap üëè

### The Downsides ‚Äì SEO, Speed, and Domain Names

There are three major issues with using Notion as a website or digital garden:

1. **Poor SEO** ‚Äì Notion pages aren't designed for __search engine optimization__ (SEO). This means anything you publish to your garden won't be easy to find via search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo. This might not seem like a big deal, but it means people who would find your content useful and relevant might never find it. 
2. **Slow Speeds** ‚Äì Notion isn't optimised for speed. It can be very slow to load on mobile devices. If you have a lot of images on your Notion garden this slows things down even more.
3. **No Custom Domain Names** ‚Äì Your domain name is the URL people type into their address bar to get to your site (eg. _gardening.com_). Having a domain name that is memorable and not too long makes it easier for people to remember the address and share your site with others. When you build a garden on Notion, you can't choose your own domain name.

### The Solution: Notion-as-a-website Services

Luckily, there's a solution to all the disappointing issues I just described.

I currently recommend Notion since it's the best option out there. However, I know a number of startups are currently trying to build digital gardening tools that make it easier for non-technical folks to join in the gardening movement. Most of them are in beta at the moment, but I'm hoping by this time next year we'll have much better options to pick from.

If you're new to the term _Digital Gardening_ I suggest you read my essay on the [[History and Ethos of Digital Gardening]] first.

The quick version is that digital gardening is a new way to think about the way we present personal knowledge online. Up until recently, blogging has been our de facto standard. We post finished pieces in reverse-chronological order, and expect people to browse through them based on how recently they were published.

Gardening tries to hard exit out of that time-based structure. It instead focuses on creating deeply interlinked posts, and allows people to browse them based on content, rather than publish date. 

There's a few more details to the practice, but I want to focus on the practicalities of how you build a digital garden here.

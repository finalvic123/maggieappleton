My [[Roam Garden]] is a place I spend between 2-4 hours puttering around in every day according to my <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> stats <Footnote idName={1}>RescueTime only tracks the time you're actively focused on a single window, so this measurement has some limitations but sets a nice baseline</Footnote>

<Image width="650px" alt="A bar graph of the hours I've spent in Roam this week" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_660/v1590188743/maggieappleton.com/notes/roamhours.png" />

<p>If I'm staring into something for over twenty hours a week, it better look and feel like beautiful home that fits my aesthetic tastes. <Footnote idName={2}>As a maker of aesthetically pleasing things, I'm obviously biased towards the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic%E2%80%93usability_effect">Aesthetic Usability Effect</a></Footnote></p>

In that spirit, I've gone all-out on customising the CSS that controls how my Roam looks.

I've used colours and font weight to distinguished internal from external links, added custom colours to particular page names, and shifted the contrast and spacing of elements to fit my own design aesthetic.

<h2>How to Paint Roam Your Own Colours</h2>

<p>Luckily, this is all fairly easy to do. Roam has a built-in system for customising how your database looks.</p>

You first need to create a new page called `roam/css`.

<ImageFrame alt="The roam search bar with roam/css entered" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1607173029/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.47.43.png" />

Once there, create a new code block by typing `/code` and selecting the block option.

<ImageFrame alt="Entering /code into the empty page" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1607173035/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.48.46.png" />

Once the code block appears, set the language to `css` from the right-hand drop down menu.

<ImageFrame alt="Selecting the code option from the code block dropdown menu" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1607173038/maggieappleton.com/notes/roam-garden/Screenshot_2020-12-05_at_12.48.56.png" />

You're now ready to start customising the CSS of your Roam. Any CSS you enter into this new code block will be applied across your whole database.

To test if it's working, type `h1.rm-title-display span { color: salmon;}` into the box.  
The title of your new page should change to a lovely shade of salmon.

#### If you've not entirely sure what CSS is, or you've never written any, I strongly suggest you first work through this short course on Khan Academy

<p><a noTip href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css/intro-to-css/pt/css-basics"><button style={{marginTop: '0.2em'}}>Intro to CSS on Khan Academy</button> </a></p>

<p>It'll take 30 minutes and learning the basics will give you an enourmous appreciation for how the web works (as well as how to control it for your own benefit!)</p>

<p>After that, check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css">this Google guide</a> to how to look up CSS elements and selectors a live webpage.</p>

For those of you entirely uninterested in learning CSS who just want to pop a pre-made theme in, Roam has a whole collection of [pre-made themes](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY) you can pick from.

Copy and paste any of them into your new `roam/css` page and the styles will be applied across your whole database

If you want to use my theme **Leyendecker**, the most up-to-date version is avaliable this [Github repo](https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css). There's a older version listed on the [Roam database](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/help/page/fJRcVITNY).


Once you've got Stylus working, you can grab my whole Roam theme <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css">here on Github</a>

## Create Custom Styles for Specific Roam Tags and Page Links

Another neat trick I love with CSS and Roam is creating specific styles for different page tags. <Footnote idName={3}>Shoutout to fellow Roam user <a href="https://malcolmocean.com/">Malcolm Ocean</a> who lobbied for this as an official feature of the Roam interface. I found out how to do it digging around in their impressively <a href="https://gist.github.com/malcolmocean/03d777a1c8f89be8c98e3d89d6821607">comprehensive CSS files</a></Footnote>

I have a little workflow taxonomy going that covers different kinds of output and the stages they flow through

<Image alt="A screencapture of my Roam database with various coloured tags" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1457/v1590193543/maggieappleton.com/notes/datatags.png" />


<p>We're able to do this because when we use a # to create a page tage, Roam adds a 'data-tag' element to the HTML markup.</p>


```html
<span data-tag="Ideas" class="rm-page-ref rm-page-ref-tag">  
    #Ideas What if I learned how to chuck wood
    like a Chuck Norris woodchuck could? 
</span>
```

We can then target this element with a CSS selector that looks like this:

```css
span.rm-page-ref[data-tag="Ideas"] {
    color: #FCB815;
    padding: 3px 4px;
    font-weight: 700;
    line-height: 1.4em;
}
```

It makes an enormous difference in your user experience to be able to quickly identify different block and note types through visual colour association.

If you just want to grab the data-tag components from my theme , scroll down to the bottom of my <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/leyendecker.css">CSS theme file</a> to find them.

### Alternate styling with browser plugins

If you don't want to use the native Roam CSS functionality, there's a way to apply custom CSS styles to any website using a browser plugin.

This is especially useful if you're part of a **multi-player** Roam where everyone has their own styling preferences.

<p><a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/">Stylus</a> is a great choice and has extensions for both <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en">Chrome</a></p>

<ImageFrame alt="A screen capture of the stylus interface" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_1720/v1590188865/maggieappleton.com/notes/stylus.png" />

They also have <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Editor">good documentation</a> that will walk you through how to use it.

It's good to note that this is not a Roam-specific hack.  You can re-paint any webpage you like with a custom CSS styler (go to town on Craigslist!)

<IntroParagraph>

In 1965, [Ted Nelson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson) imagined a system of interactive, extendable text where words would be freed from the constraints of paper documents. This _hypertext_ would make documents linkable. Twenty years later, Tim Berners Lee would take inspiration from Nelson's vision, as well as other narratives like Vannevar Bush's [Memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex), to create the world wide web. Hypertext came to life.

</IntroParagraph>

But hypertext was only one small concept amidst a sea of ideas Nelson spent his life developing. Most were entwined in his grand vision of [Project Xanadu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu) â€“ a piece of software intended to transform the way we connect documents and knowledge. Much like the web ending up being. Xanadu is often framed as an alternative to the web â€“ "the web that could have been" â€“ if it had ever shipped. Unfortunately [it didn't](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/).

Despite the fact we're not currently browsing the Xanadu web, Nelson is still full of provocative, insightful ideas that never quite came to life â€“ some that speak to many of the issues currently plaguing the modern web.

Two of the most intruiging are **Transclusion** and **Transcopyright**, a pair of concepts that reimagine the way authorship, attribution, copyright, and content monetization might work online.

## Transclusion

Transclusion is embedding one part of a document into another, and maintaing a link between the two. This is different to copying. A copy isn't inherently linked to it's original, and can be changed in the duplicate version.

A transclusion is the exact same content as the original. If it changes on the original source, it also changes anywhere that transclusion is embedded. There's a single source of truth for that element.

This idea is powerful in both the possibilities and horrors it might open up. It would allow us to always know where content came from, and see it in its original context. A capitvating promise in the age of post-truth informational relativism. 

Authors could easily fix typos and have it propogate across the web, or write revisions and push version updates the same way we do with software. On the flip side, we can also imagine paragaph tags that once held bible quotes suddenly being updated to hold fiery smut.

## Transcopyright

Transcopyright is an extension of transclusion that begins to make this very interesting for attribution, copyright, and monetization.

If text is able to be endlessly embedded across the web in a way that leads back to a single source and a single publisher, you can theoretically pay that person for every instance of their content showing up on the web.

In this alternate web utopia, readers would pay microscopic amounts for reading content on the web (we're talking fractions of a cent for an article, not the $5-10 a month level most Patreons and subscription services run at), and some portion of that would flow back to the original author.

There are a thousand open questions here about the logistics of how that would work, but it's not outside the realm of human imagination. We now have the [Web Monetization API](https://webmonetization.org/) up and running, and inevitably the words "blockchain" and "cryptocurrency" might have to be involved here. I'm not brave enough to speculate beyond that.

## Designing Speculative Interfaces

My immediate reaction to this conceptual pair was to try and grasp onto a more grounded version of it. What would this look like in a real interface? What kind of visual representations and interactions would make this possible? How would I create a transclusion, or pay someone through transcopyright?

#### Let's play a design game and think this through.

Here's a snippet of text I lifted from a recent Wired article, [To Mend a Broken Internet, Create Online Parks](https://www.wired.com/story/to-mend-a-broken-internet-create-online-parks/) by Eli Parser:

<SimpleCard width="780px">

"Thereâ€™s a problem of public imagination. Fixing our ability to connect and build healthy communities at scale is arguably an Apollo mission for this generationâ€”a decisive challenge that will determine whether our society progresses or falls back into conspiracy-driven tribalism. We need to summon the creative will worthy of a problem of this urgency and consequence."

</SimpleCard>

I've copied and pasted the text from the article. You can click the link above to view it in context, but you're going to have to scan the entire page to find the section I copied this from â€“ your browser isn't going to scroll you to the correct point or highlight the relevant text because it's not a very smart link ðŸ˜•.

The original source also has no clue I've copied and pasted from it. Nothing on Wired's article shows how many people have linked to or quoted their article - it currently looks like this:

<ImageFrame src="https://p-ZmFjNlQ.b3.n0.cdn.getcloudapp.com/items/geuoQpb4/d63e913c-dc63-4643-933f-e98d9b0368f7.jpg?v=15fe4f207f02029a4dbbb83471f6add0" width="800px" />

Which means we have absolutely no visiblity into who else on the web is responding to and building off this piece of writing. If other people have also copied and pasted this snippet of text, adding on their thoughts and ideas, we'll never know. <Footnote idName={1}>I'm not saying any of those responses are necessarily good or worth reading. They might all be crap troll comments. But I at least want some visual indication they exist. </Footnote> Unless we really go digging through pages of Google search result for it. Which we're certainly not going to without good reason. 

**Transclusion** would make this whole scenario quite different. Let's imagine this again...

As I'm reading this article on Wired, perhaps small indicators show up with transclusion counts â€“ the number of times each paragraph element or image on the page has been cited somewhere else on the web.

My <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Garden</a> is a place I spend between 2-4 hours puttering around in every day according to my <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> stats <Footnote count={1}>RescueTime only tracks the time you're actively focused on a single window, so this measurement has some limitations but sets a nice baseline</Footnote>

If I'm staring into something for over twenty hours a week, it better look and feel like beautiful home that fits my aesthetic tastes. <Footnote count={2}>As a maker of aesthetically pleasing things, I'm obviously biased towards the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic%E2%80%93usability_effect">Aesthetic Usability Effect</a></Footnote>

In that spirit, I've gone all-out on customising the CSS that controls how my Roam looks.

## How to Paint Roam Your Own Colours 

Luckily, this is all fairly easy to do.  You first need to install a browser plugin that lets you override the default CSS styles for any website.

<p><a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/">Stylus</a> is a great choice and has extensions for both <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en">Chrome</a></p>

They also have <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Editor">good documentation</a> that will walk you through how to use it.

It's good to note that this is not a Roam-specific hack.  You can re-paint any webpage you like with a custom CSS styler (go to town on Craigslist!)

Once you've got Stylus working, you can grab my whole Roam theme <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/mappletons.css">here on Github</a>

There's also a dark version on <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes">that same repo</a> built by my gardening buddy <a href="https://www.ianjones.us/">Ian Jones</a> (who has since jumped ship on Roam for Doom Emacs <span>ðŸ˜œ</span>)

## Create Custom Styles for Specific Roam Tags and Page Links

Another neat trick I love with CSS and Roam is creating specific styles for different page tags.

I have a little workflow taxonomy going that covers different kinds of output and the stages they flow through

<Image alt="A screencapture of my Roam database with various coloured tags" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1590193543/maggieappleton.com/notes/Screenshot_2020-05-23_at_01.24.49.png" />


We're able to do this because when we use a # to create a page tage, Roam adds a 'data-tag' element to the HTML markup.

```html
<span data-tag="Ideas"
    class="rm-page-ref rm-page-ref-tag">
        #Ideas What if I learned how to chuck wood
        like a Chuck Norris woodchuck could? 
</span>
```

We can then target this element with a CSS selector that looks like this:

```css
span.rm-page-ref[data-tag="Ideas"] {
    color: #FCB815;
    padding: 3px 4px;
    font-weight: 700;
    line-height: 1.4em;
}
```

It makes an enormous difference in your user experience to be able to quickly identify different block and note types through visual colour association.

If you just want to grab the data-tag components from my theme , scroll down to the bottom of my <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/mappletons.css">CSS theme file</a> to find them.

I also made a short, rough demo video showing exactly how I do this:

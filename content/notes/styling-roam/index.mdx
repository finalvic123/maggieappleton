My <a href="#">Roam Garden</a> is a place I spend between 2-4 hours puttering around in every day according to my <a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a> stats <Footnote count={1}>RescueTime only tracks the time you're actively focused on a single window, so this measurement has some limitations but sets a nice baseline</Footnote>

<Image alt="A bar graph of the hours I've spent in Roam this week" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_660/v1590188743/maggieappleton.com/notes/roamhours.png" />

If I'm staring into something for over twenty hours a week, it better look and feel like beautiful home that fits my aesthetic tastes. <Footnote count={2}>As a maker of aesthetically pleasing things, I'm obviously biased towards the  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetic%E2%80%93usability_effect">Aesthetic Usability Effect</a></Footnote>

In that spirit, I've gone all-out on customising the CSS that controls how my Roam looks.

## How to Paint Roam Your Own Colours 

Luckily, this is all fairly easy to do.  You first need to install a browser plugin that lets you override the default CSS styles for any website.

<p><a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/">Stylus</a> is a great choice and has extensions for both <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/styl-us/">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en">Chrome</a></p>

They also have <a href="https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Editor">good documentation</a> that will walk you through how to use it.

It's good to note that this is not a Roam-specific hack.  You can re-paint any webpage you like with a custom CSS styler (go to town on Craigslist!)

Once you've got Stylus working, you can grab my whole Roam theme <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes/blob/master/mappletons.css">here on Github</a>

There's also a dark version on <a href="https://github.com/theianjones/roam-research-themes">that same repo</a> built by my gardening buddy <a href="https://www.ianjones.us/">Ian Jones</a> (who has since jumped ship on Roam for Doom Emacs <span>ðŸ˜œ</span>)

## Create Custom Styles for Specific Roam Tags and Page Links

Another neat trick I love with CSS and Roam is creating specific styles for different page tags.

I have a little workflow taxonomy going that covers different kinds of output like and the stages they flow through

<Image src="" />

We're able to do this because when we use a # to create a page tage, Roam adds a 'data-tag' element to the HTML markup.

```
<span tabindex="-1" data-tag="Ideas" class="rm-page-ref rm-page-ref-tag">What if I learned how to chuck wood like a woodchuck could?#Ideas</span>
```

We can then target this element with a CSS selector that looks like this:

```
span.rm-page-ref[data-tag="Ideas"] {
    color: #FCB815;
    padding: 3px 4px;
    font-weight: 700;
    line-height: 1.4em;
}
```

It makes an enormous difference in your user experience to be able to quickly identify different block and note types through colour association.

I made a short, rough tutorial video showing exactly how I do this:

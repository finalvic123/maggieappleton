My [Roam Garden](./roam-garden) is a place I spend between 2-4 hours puttering around in every day according to my [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) stats <Tooltip tiptext="RescueTime only tracks the time you're actively focused on a single window, so this measurement has some limitations but sets a nice baseline">1</Tooltip>

If I'm staring into something for over twenty hours a week, it better look and feel like beautiful home that fits my aesthetic tastes.

As a maker of aesthetically pleasing things, I'm obviously biased towards the  [Aesthetic Usability Effect](./aestheticusability)

This is not a Roam-specific hack. You can re-paint any webpage you like with a custom CSS styler.

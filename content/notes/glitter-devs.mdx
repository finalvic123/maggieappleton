I've been seeing an increasing amount of baby pink on developer Twitter. 

In lieu of the hooded figures in dark rooms, boxy hardware, and streams of neon green characters that we traditionally associate with code nerds and computer geeks, there's been a sudden influx of pastel shades and baby animals.

It's an aesthetic that feels like walking into a Sailor Moon episode. Bright, sparkling rainbows and unicorns waft by a soft pink backdrop. Everything looks like a puffy, dusted marshmallow.

For lack of a better term, I'm calling this style "_femme dev_." To be clear, by _femme_ I don't mean "for women." 

We hopefully all know this by know, but just in case anyone hasn't read [Judith Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_Trouble) and needs to be caught up, sex (man / woman) is [not the same](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_and_gender_distinction) thing as gender (male / female). 

_Feminine_ and _masculine_ are socially constructed roles, behaviours, activites, and attributes. The way we walk, talk, sit, dress, and decorate our laptops all have the potential to be '_read_' as either masculine or feminine by those around us. Or somewhere in between. It's all a big fuzzy spectrum. 

Our ideas about what reads as feminine or masculine is fluid and culturally relative, and its constantly shifting and changing under our feet. For example, we have only associated the colour pink with feminity for the last 100 years. <Footnote idName={1}>Good read by The Atlantic on this - [Pink Wasn't Always Girly](https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/08/pink-wasnt-always-girly/278535/)<br/>"In the 18th century, it was perfectly masculine for a man to wear a pink silk suit with floral embroidery"</Footnote>

Given our current historical moment, the aesthetic on display here draws on an established history of traditionally feminine visual styles. That certainly doesn't mean that it is designed for women, or off limits to men.

Amy Wibowo who runs [bubblesort.io](https://shop.bubblesort.io/) is one of the folks at the centre of this fuzzy, adorable shift. Their zines, keyboard designs, and sweatshirts bring an intentionally femimine vibe to an industry overwhelmingly staffed by self-identifying males. <Footnote idName={2}>An unsurprising 91.1% male according to 2020's State of JS [survey](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/demographics/gender) </Footnote>

Considering the plethora of males in development, the rise of femme aesthetics is perhaps both curious and not.

I've been seeing an increasing amount of baby pink on developer Twitter. 

In lieu of the hooded figures in dark rooms, boxy hardware, and streams of neon green characters that we traditionally associate with code nerds and computer geeks, there's been a sudden influx of pastel shades and baby animals.

For lack of a better term, I'm calling this style "_femme dev_." It's an aesthetic that feels like walking into a Sailor Moon episode. Bright, sparkling rainbows and unicorns waft by a soft pink backdrop. Everything looks like a puffy, dusted marshmallow.

Amy Wibowo who runs [bubblesort.io](https://shop.bubblesort.io/) is one of the folks at the centre of this fuzzy, adorable shift. Their zines, keyboard designs, and sweatshirts bring an intentionally femimine vibe to an industry overwhelmingly staffed by males. <Footnote idName={1}>An unsurprising 91.1% male according to 2020's State of JS [survey](https://2020.stateofjs.com/en-US/demographics/gender) </Footnote>

Considering the plethora of males in development, the rise of femme aesthetics is perhaps both curious and not.

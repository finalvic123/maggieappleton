<p><a href="http://reganmian.net/blog/">Stian Haklev</a>, a fellow <a href="/roam-garden">Roam Gardener</a> and twitter friend, clued me in to the field of <b>Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning</b></p>

Much like the name suggests, it's an academic discipline exploring the possibilities of pedagogy and education where **collaboration** and **computers** are first-class considerations.

Rather than treating digital mediums as a supportive system or extra add-on in a normal classroom environment, they're The Main Thing. And rather than focusing on how _individuals_ learn and understand, knowledge building as a _group_ is prioritised.

TLDR; it's an entire academic discipline studying how we can build digitally-mediated <a href="http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Community_of_practice">Communities of Practice</a> for learning.

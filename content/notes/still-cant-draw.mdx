I know plenty of intelligent and highly motivated folks who are dying to learn to draw. Some are so intent on their desire, they've gone out and bought themselves iPads. The other half are actively thinking about buying an iPad right now.

They message me a lot.

> Which iPad should I buy? What app do you use? What brush is that?

These questions aren't wrong. On the surface they're perfectly logical. 

I draw on an iPad. In procreate. Using an apple pencil. How are you supposed to draw if you don't also have these tools?

This is the tricky bit. If you go out and buy yourself these same things, you'll have all the right __materials__ to draw. But that's only the dressing on the drawing dish.

# What you have is **Material** without **Medium** or the **Meat**

What on earth do I mean by _material_, _medium_, and _meat_?

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Materials' description={<p>Materials are the physical tools you draw with. Suffice to say, you need some way to make visible marks on a surface. Having precise control over how you make those marks is essential. Being able to erase is helpful. Having access to all the colours of the rainbow is a delightful bonus.<br/><br/>iPads & Procreate are one option. Staedler felt pens and moleskines are another. Copic markers in Cottonwood Arts sketchbooks. Compressed charcoal on Canson coldpress paper. Progressos on  newsprint. These are all good options.<br /><br/> Everyone obsesses over the materials when they want to begin drawing. Which exact pen? What brand of paper? These questions matter. A little. Your materials affect when you can and can't do. But they don't matter nearly as much as everyone thinks they do. Pick any of the above suggestions and move onto the next step as soon as possible.</p>} />

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Medium' description={<p>Drawing is a form of language. Just like written essays or spoken rhetoric, visual language has it's own syntax, style, and elements we use to communicate. Composition. Value. Contrast. Light. Shadow. Colour. Form. Shape language. Linear perspective. 3D construction. Line weight. Emphasis. Pattern. Balance. Rhythm. These are your letters, words, sentences, and paragraphs.<br /><br />Mastering the medium is the true struggle of drawing. Not picking which iPad app to draw in. The material is a convenient distraction when understanding the medium is an incomprehensible and daunting task.<br /><br /> You are right to be afraid of the medium. I'm still afraid of it. Learning all it's dimensions and elements is a lifelong challenge. It's an <a href="/infinite-games">infinite game</a>. There is no end goal. You just get to keep playing. </p>} />

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Meat' description={<p>This is the whole point of your illustration. What is your drawing <i>about? </i>  Visuals are just a language we use to communicate with other human minds. If we're going to put in the effort of crafting an entire illustration, we need to have something to say. There's an idea, a concept, or a piece of information we're trying to move from our minds into the minds of other people. Without meat, you're not serving any brain food to your audience. Which is why paintings of vases and fruit are disastrously dull. <Footnote idName={1}>IMHO, you might be really into vase paintings. Just not my cup of tea. They don't say much other that "look, a vase!"</Footnote></p>} />

Worrying about the materials should take up - at most - 10% of your attention and concern.

Focus 70-80% of your attention on learning the medium while you're just starting out.

You can keep 10-20% of your focus on the meat. But I wouldn't worry too much about communicating original, profound ideas at first. Doing so _in addition to_ learning a whole new language is going to be overwhelming.

In the same way it's a bad idea to learn Spanish by writing a philosophy dissertation in it.

Once you get more comfortable "speaking" in visual language, you'll be able to shift a much higher percentage of your attention onto the meat. Onto the thing you want to say, and how to use visual language to say it well.

That's the ideal I'm currently striving for. I no longer need to pay attention to the material, I know the medium well enough to work with it unconsciously, and I get to focus on the meat.

2% Material, 28% Medium, 70% Meat.

<IntroParagraph>

The *intantness* of chat apps has always been a mystery to me.  
The technical details of moving emojis through The Internet Pipes and across continents in 0.004 miliseconds is well beyond my paygrade.

</IntroParagraph>

But I got a tiny window of insight into the magic while illustrating notes for [Mark Barton's course](https://egghead.io/courses/vue-and-socket-io-for-real-time-communication) on building chat apps with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)

Turns out it's not magic, but instead done through  [websockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). Which are like little portals that hold open a consistent connection between two machines.

I obviously still haven't a clue what goes on inside that dark little portal. Thankfully using tools like Vue & Socket.io save us from that level of depth.

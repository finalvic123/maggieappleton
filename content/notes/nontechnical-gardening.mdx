<IntroParagraph>

Setting up your own [[Digital Garden]] can be a pretty tricky affair. <Footnote idName={1}>If you're new to the idea of digital gardening I suggest you read my essay on the [history and ethos](/garden-history) of it first.</Footnote> Up until recently, the options for folks who don't already know how to build a website with modern front-end frameworks were limited. 

</IntroParagraph>

All of the early digital gardens were built by web developers, simply because the idea was new, and we had the ability to roll our own solutions. But the idea of treating your personal website like a  garden is [spreading](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/), and lots of non-technical people are looking for ways to cultivate their own corner of the web. <Footnote idName={2}>I want to acknowledge calling anyone  _non-technical_ is controversial, since it suggests some people are inherently unable to code or wade through complex digital tools. I obviously don't believe that's the case, but want to recognise some folks feel less confident and comfortable with digital systems than others.</Footnote> There's a clear need for digital gardening tools and platforms that don't require you to write JavaScript, configure a DNS setup, or understand how to clone a GitHub repo via the command line.

Dozens of people have messaged me asking how they can get started building a garden if they don't know how to code. I used to point them to my Github collection of [digital gardening tools](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), but mumble apologies because most of the solutions listed there require a reasonably high level of technical literacy.

I hated telling these folks I didn't know how to help them. 

Thankfully, that's starting to change. Over the last year, a number of tools have popped up that make it _much_ easier to plant a digital garden without touching code.

## Gardening with Roam

[Roam Garden](https://roam.garden/) using [Roam Research]()

## Gardening with Notion

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is one of my top picks for building a digital garden when you're not code-savvy.

Notion claims it's a note-taking app for teams ‚Äì a shared space for documentation and planning. Which it is. However, it's also secretly one of the best tools for building no-code websites. 

<ImageFrame alt="The Notion homepage which presents itself as a notes app for teams" showalt width="900px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1619458405/maggieappleton.com/notes/notion-garden/Screenshot_-_2021-04-26_18.32.37_gqmsuc.png" />

Think of Notion as Google Docs on steroids. It allows you to creates pages of text using plain markdown. You can then style that text, create multi-column layouts, add images, embed links, and build spreadsheets in the middle of a document. You can also link these pages together, which begins to make Notion look strangely like a simple website builder. ü§î

I won't go into the details of how to use Notion here ‚Äì they have an extensive set of [guides](https://www.notion.so/guides) you should take a look at if you're unfamiliar with the app.

The killer feature we care about here is the "Share to Web" button. You can create a Notion document and publish it to a link on the web. Anyone can visit that link and view your document. You now essentially have a website without needing to worry about hosting, domains, web frameworks, or CMS's. üëè Slow üëè Clap üëè

A couple of folks have built their gardens in Notion already. These are very helpful to take a look at and think about ways you might organise your own content.



### Notion's Downsides ‚Äì SEO, Speed, and Domain Names

There are three major issues with using Notion as a website or digital garden:

1. **Poor SEO** ‚Äì Notion pages aren't designed for __search engine optimization__ (SEO). This means anything you publish to your garden won't be easy to find via search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo. This might not seem like a big deal, but it means people who would find your content useful and relevant might never find it. 
2. **Slow Speeds** ‚Äì Notion isn't optimised for speed. It can be very slow to load on mobile devices. If you have a lot of images on your Notion garden this slows things down even more.
3. **No Custom Domain Names** ‚Äì Your domain name is the URL people type into their address bar to get to your site (eg. _gardening.com_). Having a domain name that is memorable and not too long makes it easier for people to remember the address and share your site with others. When you build a garden on Notion, you can't choose your own domain name.

### The Solution: Notion-as-a-website Services

Luckily, there are solutions to all the disappointing issues I just described. 

Three services have appeared that help you turn your Notion into a more legitimate website with SEO indexing, faster pages, and custom domain names: [Fruition](https://fruitionsite.com/) (free), [Super](https://super.so/) ($12/month) and [Host Notion](https://hostnotion.co/) ($5/month) <Footnote idName={3}>None of these services have paid me to recommend them, and those aren't affiliate links. I haven't personally used them myself, so take a look at each option and decide for yourself.</Footnote>

I know a number of startups are currently trying to build digital gardening tools that make it easier for non-technical folks to join in the gardening movement. Most of them are in beta at the moment, but I'm hoping by this time next year we'll have much better options to pick from.

It doesn't mean you can't start your garden in the meantime. Notion isn't going anywhere.

If you're new to the term _Digital Gardening_ I suggest you read my essay on the [[History and Ethos of Digital Gardening]] first.

The quick version is that digital gardening is a new way to think about the way we present personal knowledge online. Up until recently, blogging has been our de facto standard. We post finished pieces in reverse-chronological order, and expect people to browse through them based on how recently they were published.

Gardening tries to hard exit out of that time-based structure. It instead focuses on creating deeply interlinked posts, and allows people to browse them based on content, rather than publish date. 

There's a few more details to the practice, but I want to focus on the practicalities of how you build a digital garden here.

<IntroParagraph>

Setting up your own [[Digital Garden]] can be a pretty tricky affair. <Footnote idName={1}>If you're new to the idea of digital gardening I suggest you read my essay on the [history and ethos](/garden-history) of it first.</Footnote> Up until recently, the options for folks who don't already know how to build a website with modern front-end frameworks were limited. 

</IntroParagraph>

Most of the early digital gardeners were web developers, but the idea of treating your personal website like a  garden is [spreading](https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/09/03/1007716/digital-gardens-let-you-cultivate-your-own-little-bit-of-the-internet/), and lots of non-technical people are looking for ways to cultivate their own corner of the web. <Footnote idName={2}>I want to acknowledge calling anyone  _non-technical_ is controversial, since it suggests some people are inherently unable to code or wade through complex digital tools. I obviously don't believe that's the case, but want to recognise some folks feel less comfortable programming and troubleshooting digital systems than others.</Footnote> There's a clear need for digital gardening tools and platforms that don't require you to write JavaScript, configure a DNS setup, or understand how to clone a GitHub repo via the command line.

Dozens of people have messaged me asking how they can get started building a garden if they don't know how to code. I used to point them to my Github collection of [digital gardening tools](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners), but mumble apologies because most of the solutions listed there require a reasonably high level of technical literacy.

I hated telling these folks I didn't know how to help them. 

Thankfully, that's starting to change. Over the last year, a number of tools have popped up that make it _much_ easier to plant a digital garden without touching code.

## Gardening with Notion

[Notion](https://www.notion.so/) is one of the easiest and quickest ways to start building a digital garden when you're not code-savvy.

Notion claims it's a note-taking app for teams ‚Äì a shared space for documentation and planning. Which it is. However, it's also secretly one of the best tools for building no-code websites. 

<ImageFrame alt="The Notion homepage which presents itself as a notes app for teams" showalt width="900px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1619476135/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/notionhome.png" />

Think of Notion as Google Docs on steroids. It allows you to create pages of text using plain markdown. You can then style that text, create multi-column layouts, add images, embed links, and build spreadsheets in the middle of a document. You can also link these pages together, which begins to make Notion look strangely like a simple website builder. ü§î

I won't go into the details of how to use Notion here. If you're new to Notion I recommend you watch this [intro video](https://www.notion.so/guides/notion-training-the-basics) (8 mins), play around in the app for a bit, watch their [advanced tutorial](https://www.notion.so/guides/notion-training-advanced) (13 mins), then watch [How to Publish Notion Pages](https://www.notion.so/guides/publish-notion-pages-to-the-web) to the web. This should give you the 80/20 on how Notion works.

The two killer features that make digital gardening possible in Notion are **backlinks** and **share to web.**

**Backlinks** are a [fairly new feature](https://www.notion.so/guides/creating-links-and-backlinks) in Notion. They make it possible to create [[Bi-directional Links]] between pages, meaning each page shows which other pages are linked to it. This allows you to build up deeply interlinked content ‚Äì one of the hallmarks of a digital garden. People browsing your garden can jump between related pages anywhere on the site, rather than only being able to navigate posts in chronological order.

<ImageFrame width="800px" showalt alt="Backlinks in Notion show up right underneath the title of a page" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1619473460/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/Screenshot_-_2021-04-26_22.43.04_eonejw.png" />


The second important feature is the **Share to Web** button. This allows you to create a Notion document and publish it to the web in one click. Anyone can visit that link and view your document. You now essentially have a website without needing to worry about hosting, domains, web frameworks, or a CMS. üëè Slow üëè Clap üëè

You can find Notion's __Share to Web__ feature under the __Share__ menu in the top right corner of each page.

<ImageFrame width="1000px" showalt alt="An example of where to find Notion's 'Share to Web' settings" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1619470978/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/Screenshot_-_2021-04-26_22.02.40_bqjnft.png" />

I went ahead and built a very small, pretend digital garden to show you how this might work. I created a few basic pages (about and contact me), and built two databases ‚Äì one for writing and one for books. Here's [the live version](https://www.notion.so/Maggie-s-Pretend-Garden-ad29880fed054ba1a0872d3e06252f81) you can poke around.

<ImageFrame width="1000px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1619473457/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/Screenshot_-_2021-04-26_22.43.49_fdbeyy.png" alt="My example digital garden in Notion" showalt />

This example is very basic, so it will probably help to look at more fully grown Notion gardens like [Philip in the Woods](https://philipb.cc/) and [Chinarut's Digital Greenhouse](https://www.notion.so/Chinarut-s-Digital-Greenhouse-9b31c7ba8efc4bf9adcfa17a38c841ff)

#### Notion's Downsides ‚Äì SEO, Speed, and Domain Names

There are three major issues with using Notion as a website or digital garden:

1. **Poor SEO** ‚Äì Notion pages aren't designed for __search engine optimization__ (SEO). This means anything you publish to your garden won't be easy to find via search engines like Google or DuckDuckGo. This might not seem like a big deal, but it means people who would find your content useful and relevant might never find it. 
2. **Slow Speeds** ‚Äì Notion isn't optimised for speed. It can be very slow to load on mobile devices. If you have a lot of images on your Notion garden this slows things down even more.
3. **No Custom Domain Names** ‚Äì Your domain name is the URL people type into their address bar to get to your site (eg. _gardening.com_). Having a domain name that is memorable and not too long makes it easier for people to remember the address and share your site with others. When you build a garden on Notion, you can't choose your own domain name.

#### Solutions: Notion-as-a-Website Services

Luckily, there are solutions to all the disappointing issues I just described. 

Three services have appeared that help you turn your Notion into a more legitimate website with SEO indexing, faster pages, and custom domain names: [Fruition](https://fruitionsite.com/) (free, but a little technical to setup), [Super](https://super.so/) ($12/month) and [Host Notion](https://hostnotion.co/) ($5/month) <Footnote idName={3}>None of these services have paid me to recommend them, and those aren't affiliate links. I haven't personally used them myself, so take a look at each option and decide for yourself.</Footnote>

Notion is also responding to the fact more people are using it as a website-builder and improving these problems. They recently added SEO indexing if you pay for the _Personal Pro_ plan ($4/month), and are reportedly working on custom domains and speed improvements. TBD.

## Gardening with Obsidian

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is both a personal knowledge base, and a platform designed for digital gardening on the web. 

It has all the features we've come to associate with building [Second Brains](/basb) and digital gardening - [[Bi-directional Links]], hover previews on links, and graph overviews ‚Äì all built on top of local markdown files.

<ImageFrame width="1000px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1619469764/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/Screenshot_-_2021-04-26_21.40.29_oge9pw.png" />

[Moby Diction](https://publish.obsidian.md/mobydiction/notes/_About)'s garden and [LYT Kit](https://publish.obsidian.md/lyt-kit/_Start+Here)'s garden are both good examples of what a live Obsidian site looks like.

<ImageFrame width="1000px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1619861421/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/Screenshot_-_2021-05-01_10.30.13_mnlfhy.png" alt="A screenshot of an obsidian public garden" />

You have some control over over the visual presentation, but it's limited by your skills with CSS. <Footnote idName={4}>Cascading Style-Sheets are the way we apply visual styles to websites. If you've never written any, I'd highly recommend working through Khan Academy's short [Intro to HTML/CSS](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/html-css) course. It will make a world of difference helping you understand the basics of how a webpage works.</Footnote> The restricted format is fine if you're not a visual thinker and are comfortable only working in text ‚Äì you won't be able change the layout or style on individual notes. Some people will consider this a feature, not a bug. üôÉ

## Gardening with Roam

[Roam Garden](https://roam.garden/) using [Roam Research]()

<ImageFrame width="1000px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_100,w_1200/v1619474651/maggieappleton.com/notes/nontechnical-gardening/Screenshot_-_2021-04-26_23.03.14_wukh6k.png" />

Here's an [example garden](https://vlad.roam.garden/) build with Roam Garden

I know a number of startups are currently trying to build digital gardening tools that make it easier for non-technical folks to join in the gardening movement. Most of them are in beta at the moment, but I'm hoping by this time next year we'll have much better options to pick from.

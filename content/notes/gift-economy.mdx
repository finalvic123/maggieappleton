Gift economies are a system of exchange based on gift giving. Valuables are systematically given without explicit agreement of future rewards within a contained community of people.

Gift economies are generalised, non-specific, non-linear, indirect, and delayed.

The emphasis in a gift exchange is on strengthening the both between the giver and receiver. It creates a kind of "positive debt," where the two people are now tied to one another.

For every gift we receive, we feel obliged to reciprocate. Ideally, we want the return gift to be of slightly higher value than the original. But not by too much.  

If you bring me a ginger biscuit with my cup of tea, and two days later I reciprocate with a gourmet, two-tiered red velvet cake with your name in icing, we would all consider that an awkward, creepy, and overall a socially inappropriate response.

Just giving you a ginger biscuit back works well enough. Returning a gift of the exact same value resolves the debt, but also break the cycle. Everyone is even, and there’s no more need to continue biscuit-gifting if we're happy to keep the relationship even. We can safely return to the pre-biscuit-gifting-days.

However, if I have a political or personal interest in strengthening our social relationship, I need to give you a treat of slightly higher value – perhaps a chocolate hobnob or homemade scone. Which leaves you slightly indebted to me, thus compelling the gift cycle onwards.

## Gift Economies and Market Economies

We often contrast the Gift Economy with the Market Economy. This is a wild oversimplification, but humans like to think in Cultural Dichotomies. 

Market Economies are systems of exchange based on buying and selling things with money. A market exchange is **specific, quantifiable, direct, immediate, founded upon an explicit agreement**. As in, this croissant costs £1 right now.

Buying an irrationally overpriced granola bar from an airport vending machine is an example of a pure market exchange without a social layer. It’s me, a machine, and a £3 bar of sugar to help me survive this long layover.

I want food, and whoever owns this machine wants money. This is not the time or the place for a gift economy. It would be terribly inconvenient for me to rely on an unpredictable system of granola bar gifts from the strangers around me while starving in an unfamiliar airport.

There are humans who own this vending machine, who will eventually get that money. But they are very far away in time and space – both geographically and socially.  
If challenged, I would have a terrible time tracking them down and having a chat. I have only the weakest sense of a human relationship with them, and there is hardly a social bond being woven – this granola bar is about an immediate and specific exchange of needs.

Here, the market economy works wonders. Life necessities like food, shelter, and water are not good candidates for a gifting system. Which is why we tend to gift luxury items, novelties, and socks.

This is also why it's problematic when food, shelter, and water are framed as "gifts" which is sometimes how charitable donations work – as _optional_ acts of generosity.

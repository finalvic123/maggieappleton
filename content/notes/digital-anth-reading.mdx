Eight years ago, one of my Anthropology professor's introduced me to the field of [[Digital Anthropology]] (then called _[cyborg anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_anthropology)_), as well as the sub-discipline of STS (Science and Technology Studies). At twenty-one I fell for it hard.

It let to a thesis on the [[Quantified Self]] movement, technological embodiment, and [Western Cosmology](/sadness-sweetness). I'm still exploring all the same research questions now, just through different means and ends.

After a few professional detours through illustration, web design, programming, and art direction, I'm circling back to my digital anthropology roots.

it's prime time to revisit all the books and readings that got me obsessed with this field in the first place.

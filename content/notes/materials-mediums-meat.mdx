I know plenty of intelligent and highly motivated folks who are dying to learn to draw. Some are so intent on their desire, they've gone out and bought themselves iPads. The other half are actively thinking about buying an iPad right now.

They message me a lot.

> Which iPad should I buy? What app do you use? What brush is that?

These questions aren't wrong. On the surface they're perfectly logical. 

I draw on an iPad. In procreate. Using an apple pencil. How are you supposed to draw if you don't also have these tools?

This is the tricky bit. If you go out and buy yourself these same things, you'll have all the right __materials__ to draw. But that's only the dressing on the drawing dish.

You'll still be missing the __medium__ and the __meat__.

# What on earth are materials, mediums, and meat?

Every illustration you see has three layers to it.

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Materials' description='Materials are the physical tools you need to draw with. iPads are one option. Staedler felt pens and moleskines are another. Copic markers in Cottonwood Arts sketchbooks. Compressed charcoal on Canson coldpress paper. Progressos on  newsprint. ' />

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Medium' description="By medium I mean the way we communicate. When we're drawing our medium is visual language. Just like written essays or spoken rhetoric or programming in Python, it has it's own syntax and style and set of techniques. Composition. Value. Contrast. Light. Shadows. Colour. Form. Perspective. 3D Construction. Line weight. Emphasis. Balance. Mastering the medium is the true struggle of drawing. Not picking an iPad or app or brand of pen. Almost everyone focuses on the material because they don't understand the medium. The medium is hard." />

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Meat' description="This is the idea itself. If drawing is a language that we're using to communicate with other human minds, we better have something to say. There's a set of ideas, a concept, a collection of information we're trying to move from our minds into the minds of other people. This is our meat." />

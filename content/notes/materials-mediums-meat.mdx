I know plenty of intelligent and highly motivated folks who are dying to learn to draw. Some are so intent on their desire, they've gone out and bought themselves iPads. The other half are actively thinking about buying an iPad right now.

They message me a lot.

> Which iPad should I buy? What app do you use? What brush is that?

These questions aren't wrong. On the surface they're perfectly logical. 

I draw on an iPad. In procreate. Using an apple pencil. How are you supposed to draw if you don't also have these tools?

This is the tricky bit. If you go out and buy yourself these same things, you'll have all the right __materials__ to draw. But that's only the dressing on the drawing dish.

You'll still be missing the __medium__ and the __meat__.

# What on earth are materials, mediums, and meat?

Material, medium, and meat is my home-spun theory for the elements that go into a visual explanation. They're layers of technique you use to create an image.

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Materials' description="Materials are the physical tools you need to draw with. iPads are one option. Staedler felt pens and moleskines are another. Copic markers in Cottonwood Arts sketchbooks. Compressed charcoal on Canson coldpress paper. Progressos on  newsprint. They do matter - your materials affect when you can and can't do. They just don't matter as much as everyone thinks. Pick any of the above suggestions and move onto the next layer as soon as possible." />

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Medium' description="Drawing is a form of language. Just like written essays or spoken rhetoric, visual language has it's own syntax, style, and elements we use to communicate. Composition. Value. Contrast. Light. Shadows. Colour. Form. Perspective. 3D Construction. Line weight. Emphasis. Balance. Mastering the medium is the true struggle of drawing. Not picking an iPad or app or brand of pen. Everyone obsesses over the material when they don't understand the medium." />

<MMMSection sectionTitle='Meat' description="This is the idea itself. If drawing is a language that we're using to communicate with other human minds, we need to have something to say. There's an idea, a concept, or a piece of information we're trying to move from our minds into the minds of other people. Without meat, you don't have any brain food to enjoy." />

Materials should take up - at most - 10% of your attention and concern. Focus 70-80% of your attention on learning the medium while you're just starting out.

You can keep 10-20% of your focus on the meat. But I wouldn't worry too much about communicating original, profound ideas at first. Doing so _in addition to_ learning a whole new language is going to be overwhelming.

In the same way it's a bad idea to learn Spanish by writing a philosophy dissertation in it.

Once you know how to "speak" in visual language, you'll be able to shift a much higher percentage of your attention onto the meat. Onto the thing you want to say, and how to use visual language to say it well.

That's the ideal I'm currently striving for: 2% Material, 28% Medium, 70% Meat.

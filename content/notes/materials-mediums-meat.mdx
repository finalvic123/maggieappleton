I know plenty of intelligent and highly motivated folks who are dying to learn to draw. Some are so intent on their desire, they've gone out and bought themselves iPads. The other half are actively thinking about buying an iPad right now.

They message me a lot.

> Which iPad should I buy? What app do you use? What brush is that?

These questions aren't wrong. On the surface they're perfectly logical. 

I draw on an iPad. In procreate. Using an apple pencil. How are you supposed to draw if you don't also have these tools?

This is the tricky bit. If you go out and buy yourself these same things, you'll have all the right __materials__ to draw. But that's only the dressing on the drawing dish. You'll still be missing the __medium__ and the __meat__.

Materials are the physical tools you need to draw with. iPads are one option.

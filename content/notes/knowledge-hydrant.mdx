I've been looking into both [[Pattern Languages]] and [[Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning]] over the past month.

[The Knowledge Hydrant](http://www.industriallogic.com/papers/khdraft.pdf) is where these two meet in a lovely swirl of collaborative learning and organically emergent systems.

It's a draft document written up by Joshua Kerievsky in 1999. The mini-manifesto describes a set of **Design Patterns** that people can use to set up their own indie study groups outside of formal structures like universities.

While the original focused on IRL, in-person groups, I'm fascinated by how we might adapt these patterns and turn them into internet-friendly, distributed versions.

Taking notes and thinking it through...

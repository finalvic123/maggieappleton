<IntroParagraph>

When it comes to visionary, before-its-time software, it's hard to find a better archetype than Ted Nelson's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a>.

</IntroParagraph>

It's infamous in the technology community as a sixty-year project that never quite launched. A cautionary tale of what happens when you overhype, underdeliver, and try to stuff an operating system's worth of features into a single piece of proprietary software. The kind of tale that makes our ferociously lean startup culture of Move Fast, Break Things, and Demo or Die seem almost sensible.

Xanadu was a hypothetical hypertext system. <Footnote idName={1}>The word hypothetical is a bit strong. Many versions were built. There is a working demo showcasing a few of its features [here](http://xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html). But there is no active version on the App Store or  Product Hunt I can link you to.</Footnote>

It's hard to read the word _hypertext_ in 2021 and not believe its synonymous with the system Tim Berners-Lee built in 1989 – the World Wide Web that became so much more than linked text on digital screens. The version of hypertext you are reading this on is the only hypertext most of us have ever known.

And yet the idea of hypertext predates Berners-Lee by two decades. The term was coined in 1963 by none other than Ted Nelson as part of a much larger vision; one small brick in the grand Xanadu dream mansion. <Footnote idName={2}>While Nelson coined the word, the notion of linked documents goes back to Jorge Luis Borges The Garden of Forking Paths" in 1941 and Vannevar Bush's Memex machine in 1945  – both significant, named influences for Nelson. </Footnote>

To talk about Xanadu, we need to put a pin in our current understanding of _hypertext_. Our preconceived notions of what a link is, how it works, and what digital text is capable of threatens to overwrite the alternate history we're about to explore.

Ted hoped it would be a medium for "[serious electronic literature](https://xanadu.com.au/ted/XUsurvey/xuDation.html)"" – a paradigm shift that would free us from the material constraints of paper. His vision was the first to meaningfully consider how storing information in digital bits could reconfigure the way we read, write, cite, and share words.

Xanadu's failure to mature into a widespread, useable commercial product is great fodder a [dramatic cover story](https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/). One fuelled by the noticeably combative language in Xanadu's [documentation](https://xanadu.com/). "The computer world is a continual war over software politics and paradigms" where "we fight on" for "vindication" and "the last laugh." One feels like the dinner guest who has stumbled into a raging martial argument over unwashed tea towels. You don't dare ask for context.

Yet these historical skirmishes and financial flops are also the least interesting thing about Xanadu. The most interesting part is its **Pattern Language**.

<Halfspacer />

### Architectural Pattern Languages

[[Pattern Languages]] are sets of flexible, reusable solutions to common design problems. 

They come from the land of architects: the software developers of the material world. Namely, the architect [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander), whose philosophy of constructing vibrant and humane living space escaped the confines of urban planning and infused the world of software design in the late 1980's.

Alexander defined 253 architectural patterns for designing cities, towns, and homes. These became the example patterns for writing patterns. Each one is composed of a context, problem, example, and solution.

For example, the design pattern **A Place to Wait** asks that we create comfortable accommodation and ambient activity whenever someone needs to wait; benches, cafes, reading rooms, miniature playgrounds, three-reel slot machines (if we happen to be in the Las Vegas airport). This solves the problem of huddles of people awkwardly hovering in liminal space; near doorways, taking up sidewalks, anxiously waiting for delayed flights or dental operations or immigration investigations without anything to distract them from uncertain fates.

There's no single way to implement these design patterns. They are purposefully abstract enough to adapt to the situation at hand. Rules of thumb rather than sets of formulaic instructions.

### Xanadu as a Design Pattern

Taken as a collection of design patterns, Xanadu's documentation suggests solutions to some of the hypertextual problems we're wrestling with today;
- How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?
- How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
- How do we bring ideas and data from a variety of sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?

Xanadu became a sad parable, when it should have been a piece of speculative design. A set of seeds scattered into the wind for other people to pick up and plant, rather than the patent-happy industrial farming conglomerate it tried to grow into. 

Curiously enough, there appear to be rogue seedlings sprouting around the web. A number of Xanadu's design patterns are showing up in modern manifestations. We're finding ways to backwards engineer the original spirit of Xanadu into the existing structures of the World Wide Web.

# The Patterns

## 1. Visible Links

Ted Nelson has many gripes, and **jump links** are one of his biggest. They're the kind of links we all use around the web today. Clicking a hyperlink is a bit of a gamble. It _jumps_ you into somewhere unknown. You find out when you get there.

We've found ways to adapt to this. Venkatesh Rao has a compelling exploration of the [rhetoric of hyperlinking](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2009/07/01/the-rhetoric-of-the-hyperlink/) that we use to hint at where people are headed.  Most browsers also have URL previews, but they tuck them into the far corner in tiny text. These can only tell you so much when modern URLs are often obscured by link shorteners and overstuffed with tracking queries.

These solutions are only a band-aid on the underlying wound. 

Nelson considered _visible links_ an essential part of his hypertext system. In the original mockups of his "Xanadocs", linked text would be connected to its source in a rather literal fashion, with brightly coloured highlights running between documents. 

<ImageFrame width="1000px"  src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto:good,w_1000/v1589545780/maggieappleton.com/notes/xanadu.png" alt="One of the original UI mockups for a Xanadoc with visible links between text blocks" showalt />

This proposed solution relies on two other patterns – parallel documents and transpointing windows (covered below) – but the underlying principle was simply that links made their destinations clear.

The modern web has landed on some fairly decent solutions to this issue: hover previews and unfurls.

<Draft />

Link previews that contain excerpts of the destination page hint at this solution. You get to see where you're headed to before you decide to jump.

They're fairly common at this point. The <a href="https://ogp.me/">Open Graph Protocol</a> helped fuel this pattern by making it easy to generate preview cards in social media feeds.

Wikipedia added hover previews in 2018 <Footnote idName={3}><a href="https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/04/18/how-we-designed-page-previews-for-wikipedia/">Wikipedia page previews announcement</a></Footnote>

<br />

Among the [[Digital Gardening]] community, creators like <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a> have popularised the pattern on personal websites and blogs.

<br />

<p>Previews aren't quite the same as physical links between parts of a page though. You lose the fine-grained associations between specific paragraphs and lines.</p>

<p>A few members of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/roamcult">#roamcult</a> have been leaning into this association with Xanadu, and taking it to the next level. <a href="https://azlen.me/">Azlen Elza</a> recently managed to craft up this crazy demo inside of their Roam Research database:</p>

The original Xanadu vision was ambitious.  Unreasonably ambitious. The above feature list is a small selection.  

Perhaps you sense the problem.  
Solving all the things all at once gets tricky.

Instead, what we're now seeing is the ad-hoc, decentralised manifestation of Xanadu in bits and pieces.

People are building Xanadu without knowing what Xanadu is.  
Which is the essence of a good pattern language; true patterns evolve naturally within systems, and are found rather than crafted. <Footnote idName={4}>Christopher Alexander's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nature_of_Order">The Nature of Order</a> goes deep on this principle</Footnote>

In the grand scheme of things, 60 years isn't an extraordinary amount of time to spend solving a problem. It's about 0.09% of history since humans first started creating symbolic cultural artefacts <Footnote idName={5}>Using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_La_Pasiega">La Pasiega Cave</a> in Spain as a relative marker - 65,000 y.a.</Footnote>

Who knows, maybe Xanadu can still happen (if you clap for it) ✨

<!-- One of the largest efforts is led by our Web OG Tim Berners-Lee himself with <a href="">Linked Data</a> and the <a href="">Semantic Web</a>.  
While Tim and Ted have historically <a href="">had a few disagreements</a>, much of Tim's recent work would make the original Xanadu ideals possible at scale.
It's fitting that our original Web creator Tim is the one working on making these design real and usable. -->

Setting up this [Digital Garden](/digital-gardening) has been quite the pet project.

I built this site in [Gatsby]() - a static site generator that gives you a decent balance between convenience and control. I'm mostly with it for the power of ✨ MDX ✨ - my  current *favourite* technology writing posts (TLDR, fancy interactive React components baked into markdown)

But it's currently missing one killer feature

> The Bi-Directional Link

This is simply a link with social awareness - it knows about other pages or 'nodes' that point to it

When the infrastructure of the World Wide Web was setup, links were designed to be unidirectional - you can link to a site, but it hasn't a clue you've done so. This history of why this is the case is complex - the WWW was going for a more minimal implementation in favour it universal adoption. You can't ship every last  bell and whistle in the beginning.

The concept of bi-directionals goes all the way back to Ted Nelson and the perpetually-imminent Project Xanadu. Lots of people are mad, let's not get into it.

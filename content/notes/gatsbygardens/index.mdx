Setting up this <a to="https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/">digital garden</a> has been quite the pet project. 

I built it in <a to="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby</a> - a static site generator that gives you a decent balance between convenience and control. But it's currently missing one killer feature...

> ✳ The Bi-Directional Link ✳

We're all very used to the mono-directional link the Web is built around. You can link to a site, but it hasn't a clue you've done so.
They act as one-way pointers.  

We set up all these single direction paths, trying to signal relevance and context, only to have the other side completely ignore our efforts.

Our monolinks feel like they're trying to establish relationships in vain.

But a _bi-directional_ link has **social awareness** - it knows about other pages or 'nodes' that point to it. This means we get a two-way conversation flowing between our web locations.

With the recent rise of <a to ="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, the idea of bi-directional linking is having a bit of a moment. 

We've suddenly come to in our mono-linked environment, and begun to ask why it's so hard to find and keep track of relevant, contextual relationships in our information systems.

Where is the <a to="">Memex</a> of "xxx" I was promised?

It turns out this fabled bi-directional link is not new. 

The concept goes all the way back to 1945 in Bush Vannevar's infamous <a to="">Memex</a> machine, described in the essay <a to="">As We May Think</a>.

As personal computing, the concept emerged again in 1965 with <a to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Nelson">Ted Nelson</a>, who was inspired by Vannevar, and coined the term *hypertext* to describe his vision.

Nelson planned to implement these hypertextual dreams in his perpetually-imminent <Tooltip tiptext={<span>If you have some time, this is quite the <a to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">internet history rabbit hole</a> to run down. <a to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0NgV3yNd2o">Ted Nelson is on another level</a></span>}>Project Xanadu</Tooltip>. The Xanadu system imagined that every sentence, block, and page would be part of a vast bi-directionally linked network:

</Center>

Xanadu didn't pan out. And our current implementation of the World Wide Web does not support this on an infrastructre level.

While Sir Tim Berner's Lee <a to="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Topology.html">wrote himself a note</a> debating their pros and cons back in 1999, there is an obvious design issue with letting two-way connections flow freely around the web.  

If _every_ site that linked to yours was visible on your page, and you had no control over who could and couldn't link to you, it is not hard to imagine the Trollish implications...

Figuring out how we might filter, moderate, and set permissions around link visibility turned into <a to="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74236">quite the challenge</a>. The <a to="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74229">design details</a> <a to="https://dl.acm.org/doi/epdf/10.1145/74224.74245">grew complex</a>.

It became clear implementing simpler mono-directional links in favour of a wider universal adoption of the web was the right thing to do.  Lots of people are still mad about this, so let's not venture too far down the historical wormhole.

> **The TLDR is technology is hard**.

Until <a to="https://www.wired.com/1995/06/xanadu/">Xanadu ships</a> and we're all immersed in the universe of multi-linked, version-controlled nodes of remixable micro-content (that somehow solves the problems of permissions and moderation), there are still plenty of ways we can resurrect the possibility of bi-directional links on the web...

A good starting place is our personal internet homes. Specifically, internet homes with <a to="https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners">digital gardens</a>.

There's been a flurry of interest around bi-directionals among my fellow digital gardeners, originally sparked by <a to ="https://andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschuk's</a> notes


<a noStyle to ="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/"><h3 style="text-align: center;">Go have a good browse through these</h3>

<p><Tooltip tiptext="It should be noted Andy is an experienced developer and interaction designer, and these notes should not be taken as the standard expectation for the rest of us normal plebby internet citizens.">There's plenty to admire here</Tooltip>.

But the key part of this system that creates interlinked context is the <b>"Links to this Note"</b> section at the bottom of each post. </p>

Anytime Andy links to another one of their notes on the site, it'll pop up as a related note here.  This is the bi-directional dream.  
It gives us a way to navigate through these ideas in exploratory mode, rather than navigating a hierarchy of categories on a main index page.

Since it's all contained within a single-author site, our Troll-risk factor is at a comfortable zero.

## That's all very cool, but how do we build it?

Many people are <a to="https://nesslabs.com/tiddlywiki-beginner-tutorial">using TiddlyWiki</a> which looks like a fantastic option for non-developers.

However, given my desire to turn everything I touch into an over-engineering visual interactive playground, TiddlyWiki wasn't going to cut it. I needed the Gatsby version.

Luckily, <a to="https://aengusmcmillin.com/">Aengus McMillin</a> built <a to="https://github.com/aengusmcmillin/gatsby-theme-brain">gatsby-theme-brain</a> which, much like it sounds, is a Gatsby theme that will make the magic happen.

My colleague and digital gardening co-conspirator Ian Jones <a to="https://www.ianjones.us/notes">implemented the system on his site</a>.

And then for extra jazz, Ian added in preview pop-overs of note links using <a to="https://aravindballa.com/">Aravind Balla</a>'s <a to="https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy">gatsby-theme-andy</a> system which expands off gatsby-theme-brain.

Aengus, Aravind, Ian and I will be hanging out on a livestream on **May 19th** and showing how to set this whole thing up -- with this site as the guinea pig.

<!-- 
In preparation, I started planning out the UX design considerations of this feature.

### What exactly does this look like in action?

We'll need to consider a number of design issues:

1. How will users know if a link is internal or external?
    - On most sites these all look the same, and you find out where you're headed once you've clicked. Making users randomly guess where a link is headed isn't a great UX experience.
    - I like solving this with URL preview tooltips for externals (implemented with Tippy.js)
    - And I also distinguish them with colour - blue leads to the outside web, orange stays inside.
2. How can we visually distinguish between internal links that lead to pages like 'Home' or 'About' vs. links that lead to other notes?
    - Even with the colour distinction, there's now going to be two kinds of internal links - ones to "normal" pages, and ones to linked notes
3. How much content should we show in hover previews for internal page links?
4. How do we visually display page references? -->


This is mildly tangential, but I love how the topic of bi-directional links makes fully visible our "websites are locations" and "websites are containers" conceptual metaphors.  
There are *"inside"* and *"outside"* links.

I've been a [cellular agriculture](https://www.new-harvest.org/cell_ag_101) and [cultured meat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultured_meat) enthusiast for a couple of years now. If you've never heard of cultivated meat, my [illustrated notes](/meat-planet) on the fantastic book **Meat Planet** will get you caught up.

The TLDR is we've found a way to grow meat without killing animals. You can see why this might be intriguing.

At fifteen I read [Fast Food Nation](https://www.librarything.com/work/3735), [The Omnivore's Dilemma](https://www.librarything.com/work/504173), and [Stuffed and Starved](https://www.librarything.com/work/3657642) in quick succession. That was sadly the end of enjoying [hawker stall chicken rice](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/a-brief-history-of-hainanese-chicken-rice-singapores-national-dish/).

In the 14 years since, I've maintained various levels of Really Bad veganism. <Footnote idName={1}>The highly flawed and non-judgemental variety. I have no interest in policing your personal plate. </Footnote> Which is the state of knowing all the facts, understanding their moral implications, and still only making the "right choice" about 82% of the time. 

Because here's the thing. [Given the statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237464/share-of-vegans-in-the-united-states/), individuals voluntarily choosing to be vegan, and/or putting enourmous effort into convincing other people into veganism is a terrible game plan for addressing the complex, wide-ranging problems of animal agriculture:

Rather than judgementally guilt-tripping people into making _hard sacrifices_, exploring alternative ways of making meat (and meat-alternatives that aren't sad lumps of tofurkey) feels like a better use of everyone's time.

The thriving industry of cultured meat and cellular agriculture agrees. Research organisations like the [Good Food Institute](https://www.gfi.org/) and [New Harvest](https://www.new-harvest.org/) have been promoting, funding, and supporting new companies in this space over the last few years.

Keen to get involved, I talked my way into sketchnoting the 2019 [New Harvest conference](/newharvest2019) at the MIT Media Lab.

I'm now working on a new initiative with New Harvest, illustrating a series of podcast episodes around their impressive community of [research fellows](https://www.new-harvest.org/current_research_projects).

Over the summer the [Cultured Meat and Future Foods Show](https://anchor.fm/futurefoodshow/) is interviewing each research fellow. For each episode I'm doing a one-shot illustrated summaries that explains their research focus.

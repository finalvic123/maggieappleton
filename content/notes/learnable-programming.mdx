<IntroParagraph>
    
Bret Victor coined the term <b>Learnable Programming</b> in his <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming">canonical essay</a> lamenting the current state of programming education.  

</IntroParagraph>

Bret has a few concerns with the way most of us learn to code. Mainly that the learning environments we drop people into are poorly designed.

These environments tend to look something like this:

They're your standard column-based "live coding" interfaces popular across the industry. You write code into one section and hopefully get the output you expected in another. Synatx is abstracted away from the elements it affects. The structures and properties of the language itself are no where to be seen. State is invisible. 

---

It's easy to see why these linear, text-based interfaces _seem_ like the best approach. They look identical to the standard interfaces the whole development industry uses to programme.

We're training people in the same kind of environment they'll be working in professionally. In the just-get-a-job-mindset that's an excellent approach.

But Victor isn't talking about the ideal way to learn programming in the short-term, bootcampy world view. When he talks about these environments as inadequate, he's referencing a much larger paradigm shift around how we should design human-computer interfaces. 

He's pointing out that the standard text-based, disembodied, non-graphical interfaces we all put up with are unintuitive to humans who live in a highly visual, spatial, embodied world.

While most of our modern user interfaces have graduated to a graphical, 3D space-based system, programming is staunchly attached to the linear text paradigm. 

There's good reason for this. While many people have tried to develop [visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language), they've largely failed to gain traction. There's lots of [well-reasoned](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/visual-programming-language/) [arguments](https://dzone.com/articles/visual-programming-why-its-a-bad-idea) [explaining](https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2018/10/visual-programming-why-its-bad-idea.html) why it's so difficult to design visual systems complex and extensible enough to programme in. We might get there someday, but our current visual languages just aren't sophisticated enough to do the job.

While visual programming isn't great for the scale of complexity professional programmers deal with, it's _ideal_ for people who are learning to code. When the goal is simply to explain what's happening under the hood, creating graphical representations is the best way to help people build clear mental models.

## The Principles of Learnable Programming 

Bret Victor outlined a set of principles he believed all learnable programming environments should follow. He argues any good educational platform should allow learners to...
1. **Read the vocabulary** of a language by making clear what each keyword and function does
2. **Follow the flow** of what happens at each stage in executing a programme 
3. **See the state** as the programme changes variables over time
4. **Create by reacting** to how the programme behaves
5. **Create by abstracting** from the simple to the complex

I won't expand on these too much as Bret elaborates on them in the [original piece](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) and provides plenty of tangible examples of how we might implement them in an interface.

Since Bret wrote his piece in 2012, the world of programming education has stepped up its visual game. It's no longer just two column, text-based execution contexts. We're now swimming in interactive environments and gamified educational platforms. I can't say any of them meet _all_ of Bret's principles. Most only nail two or three of them. But they're all taking steps in the right direction.

## A Brief Survey of the Visual Education Landscape

I've collected up all the examples I could find of visual approaches to teaching programming. These range from full-on illustrated games to lightly animated sequences of text. The unifiying principle of all these examples isn't having cartoon characters or Nintendo-esque interactions. What makes them work is they all **map concepts to space.** Syntax moves from 1D linear lines into 2D or 3D space.

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) teach CSS layout techniques through live reactive demos.

[CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) takes the same approach to teach CSS selectors.

[Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) uses the style of a platform game to help learners get comfortable with the essential commands of Vim

## Picking Up Patterns

As I began collecting these, I started noticing repeating patterns across the platforms. There's a certain interactive language being developed here.

Bret Victor coined the term **Learnable Programming** in his [canonical essay](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) on the matter.  Bret has a few concerns with the way most of us learn programming at the moment. Mainly that it's woefully inadequate and poorly designed.

His main gripe is that the standard "live coding" environment we see everywhere in programming education tries to train humans to think more like machines. Rather than designing educational interfaces that are more intuitively understandable to humans.

These environments tend to look something like this:

</TwoCol>

They're your standard column-based interface where you write syntax into one section and hopefully get the output you expected in another.

It's easy to see why these linear, text-based interfaces feel like the best approach. They look identical to the standard interfaces the whole development industry uses to programme.

We're training people in the same kind of environment they'll be working in professionally. In the just-get-a-job-mindset that's an excellent approach.

But Victor isn't talking about the ideal way to learn programming in the short-term, bootcampy world view. When he talks about these environments as inadequate, he's referencing a much larger paradigm shift around how we should design human-computer interfaces.

Mainly that the standard text-based, disembodied, non-graphical interfaces we all put up with are unintuitive to humans who live in a highly visual, spatial, embodied world.

While most of our modern user interfaces have graduated to a graphical, 3D space-based system, programming is staunchly attached to the linear text paradigm.

[Visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language) have failed to gain traction. There's lots of [well-reasoned](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/visual-programming-language/) [arguments](https://dzone.com/articles/visual-programming-why-its-a-bad-idea) [explaining](https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2018/10/visual-programming-why-its-bad-idea.html) why it's so difficult to design visual systems complex and extensible enough to programme in. Maybe we'll get there someday, but the current visual languages just can't do what we need them to.

While visual programming isn't great for the scale of complexity professional programmers deal with, it's still perfectly suited to the needs of educational programming.

I keep a hefty collection of interactive experiences focused around programming education in particular.
And began to notice some trends â€“ an emerging [[Pattern Languages]] between these sites.

This is an incomplete and ongoing observational list.

1. Location and Destination

Showing the learner where they are now, and where they're headed.

[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

2. Brownie Points



3. Compare and Contrast

[Can't Unsee](https://cantunsee.space/)

4. Immersive Focused

5. Invitations to Explore / You Figure it Out

No obvious instructions and fully exploratory. You figure out what you're supposed to do as the game unfolds.

[Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)

[The Bezier Game](https://bezier.method.ac/)

[Kerntype](https://type.method.ac/)

[Method of Action](https://method.ac/)

6. The Invisible Narrator

7. What You See is What You Get

We may not have achieved the code-less dream for web design yet, but at least we have it in our educational games.

At the moment it's mostly CSS-focused games that can easily take advantage of this pattern, since it's inherently visual.

Both by [Codepip](https://codepip.com/) who make a number of these style of educational games

8. Explain in Context

9. Cry for Help

10. Revisit the Past

Spaced repetition

11. Flow over time

[Loupe](http://latentflip.com/loupe/)

12. Embodied Space over Symbolic text

13. Unpack the Black Box

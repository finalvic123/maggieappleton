Bret Victor coined the term **Learnable Programming** in his [canonical essay](http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming/) on the matter.  Bret has a few concerns with the way most of us learn programming at the moment. Mainly that it's woefully inadequate and poorly designed.

His main gripe is that the standard "live coding" environment we see everywhere in programming education tries to train humans to think more like machines. Rather than designing educational interfaces that are more intuitively understandable to humans.

These environments tend to look something like this:

They're your standard column-based interface where you write syntax into one section and hopefully get the output you expected in another.

It's easy to see why these linear, text-based interfaces feel like the best approach. They look identical to the standard interfaces the whole development industry uses to programme.

We're training people in the same kind of environment they'll be working in professionally. In the just-get-a-job-mindset that's an excellent approach.

But Victor isn't talking about the ideal way to learn programming in the short-term, bootcampy world view. When he talks about these environments as inadequate, he's referencing a much larger paradigm shift around how we should design human-computer interfaces.

Mainly that the standard text-based, disembodied, non-graphical interfaces we all put up with are unintuitive to humans who live in a highly visual, spatial, embodied world.

While most of our modern user interfaces have graduated to a more nuanced, graphical, space-based system, programming is staunchly attached to the linear text paradigm. [Visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language) have failed to gain traction outside of educational environments.

<IntroParagraph>
    
Bret Victor coined the term <b>Learnable Programming</b> in his <a href="http://worrydream.com/LearnableProgramming">canonical essay</a> lamenting the current state of programming education.  Bret has a few concerns with the way most of us learn to code. Mainly that the learning environments we drop people into are poorly designed.

</IntroParagraph>



These environments tend to look something like this:

<h6 style="text-align: center;" >Interfaces from Repl.it, Codesandbox, freeCodeCamp, and Khan Academy</h6>

They're your standard column-based "live coding" interfaces popular across the industry. You write code into one section, and hopefully get the output you expected in another. Syntax is abstracted away from the elements it affects.

---

### Industry-Standard Environments

It's easy to see why these linear, text-based interfaces _seem_ like the best approach. They look identical to the standard interfaces the whole development industry uses to programme.

All development takes place in an isolated text window. If you type the correct sequence of words and symbols into that editor, the correct series of events happens somewhere out of view. Functions run in an unseen JavaScript engine, interface elements appear in the browser, and somewhere a value changes in a distant database. You only get the end result. To see anything happening in the middle, you have to `console.log` out data at each step of the way. The industry has accepted flying blind as standard operating procedure.

<ImageFrame width="1000px" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dxj9qr5gj/image/upload/v1614174727/maggieappleton.com/notes/learnable-programming/learnprog_2_ieudi6.png" alt="The interface of VS Code â€“ one of the most popular apps for professional programming. If you're writing front-end code, you check the results in a separate browser window." showalt />

So we're training people in the same kind of environment they'll be working in professionally. In the just-get-a-job-mindset that's an excellent approach. But Bret isn't talking about the ideal way to learn programming in the short-term, bootcampy world view. When he talks about these environments as inadequate, he's referencing a much larger paradigm shift around how we should design human-computer interfaces. 

He's pointing out that the standard text-based, disembodied, non-graphical interfaces we all put up with are unintuitive to humans who live in a highly visual, spatial, embodied world. While most of our modern user interfaces have graduated to a graphical, 3D space-based system, programming is staunchly attached to the linear text paradigm. 

There's good reason for this. While many people have tried to develop [visual programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language), they've largely failed to gain traction. There's lots of [well-reasoned](https://www.outsystems.com/blog/posts/visual-programming-language/) [arguments](https://dzone.com/articles/visual-programming-why-its-a-bad-idea) [explaining](https://mikehadlow.blogspot.com/2018/10/visual-programming-why-its-bad-idea.html) why it's so difficult to design visual systems complex and extensible enough to programme in, so I won't repeat them here.
The fact is that our current visual languages aren't sophisticated enough to do the job, and  we're a long way from any system that could.

<Halfspacer />

### Visual Programming for Learning

While visual programming isn't great for the scale of complexity professional programmers deal with, it's _ideal_ for people who are learning to code. When we simply need to explain what's happening under the hood, graphical representations are the best way to help people build clear mental models.

Computer history legends like [Alan Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay) and [Seymour Paypert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert) were the earliest champions of using intuitive visuals to teach programming. Paypert developed a language called [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) in the late 1960's where you would type commands to direct a small green turtle around the screen, leaving a visible trail behind it. Through simple instructions like `go(20)` and `turn(90)` and `for i in range(12): go(20) turn(30)` you could draw elaborate graphic patterns. It became widely used in education and a whole generation began their programming lives in Logo.

My own earliest memory of programming involved directing one of these small green amphibians around in circles. If you want a little throwback, you can play with a live Turtle environment at [Turtle Academy](https://turtleacademy.com/playground)

The modern manifestation of Logo is MIT's [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) learning platform. It expanded the character range beyond just turtles, offering everything from llamas to dancing starfish. It also gives you the syntax as drag-n-drop blocks which visually distinguish variables from loops, logic operations, events, and motion commands.

If we look past the campy, child-friendly aesthetics of Scratch, it's hard to argue this kind of visual interface isn't helpful. There is no need to memorise the syntax, it's easy to browse through the available commands, and the physical shape and colour of each command limits makes clear where you can and can't put it. Hovering over operations shows you whether they're true or false and variables reveal their current value.

I could wax lyrical about the genius of this approach for paragraphs but I'll spare you. The [autocomplete](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense), syntax highlighting, and linter systems in modern IDEs <Footnote idName={1}>IDE stands for integrated development environment. These are pimped out code editors that offer programmers a buffet a helpful tools like debuggers, git logs, and advanced search functionality. VSCode, WebStorm, and XCode are all popular IDEs</Footnote> get us close to this, but offer just enough freedom to still hang ourselves sometimes. You also need to know IDEs exist in the first place, and _then_ learn how to setup and effectively use one; a heady challenge in itself. Many beginners flail around in blank, unresponsive code files with no autocompletion, syntax snippets, or linters to assist them until someone lets them in on the industry secret (speaking from personal experience here).

## Principles of Learnable Programming 

Let's circle back to Bret Victor and his concept of _learnable programming_. Bret outlined a set of principles he believed all programming environments should follow if they want their learners to make any headway. He argues a good environment should allow learners to:

1. **Read the vocabulary** of a language by making clear what each keyword and function does
2. **Follow the flow** of what happens at each stage in executing a programme 
3. **See the state** as the programme changes variables over time
4. **Create by reacting** to how the programme behaves
5. **Create by abstracting** from the simple to the complex

Most of these are explicitly **visual**. We need to make what's happening in the programme _readable_ through visual representations of each syntax element, variable, and change of state over time. As Bret puts it:

> "People understand what they can see. If a programmer cannot see what a program is doing, she can't understand it."

I won't expand on these too much as Bret elaborates on them in the [original piece](http://worrydream.com/#!/LearnableProgramming) and provides plenty of tangible examples of how they might look in an interface. These  principles amount to a kind of [[Pattern Language]] - they're a set of design rules that loosely define how a system should work, rather than a strict specification or implementation. 

Since Bret wrote his piece in 2012, it's recieved plenty of buzz and cultish admiration (deservedly, IMHO). But I haven't seen it fully applied in any live learning platforms. 

The world of programming education has certainly stepped up its visual game over the last decade. It's no longer just two column, text-based execution contexts. We're now swimming in interactive visual environments and gamified educational platforms.

I began researching the field to see how many of them were putting Bret's principles into practice. The examples I looked at ranged from full-on illustrated games to lightly animated sequences of text. As I explored, I started to notice design patterns beyond the principles Bret outlined.

While Bret defined a set of ideals for a hypothetical learning platform, I became more interested in finding patterns in what already exists. While we're a long way from achieving the '_ideal_' system, there's plenty of good design happening here and now.

## Current Patterns in Programming Environments


#### 1. Location and Destination
The learner should always know where they are on the learning path, and what their destination is.

This one isn't specific to visual programming â€“ it's a well-established principle of UX design that people need to know where they are, where they've been, and where they're headed.

Making this clear with a visual progress bar is common on learning platforms when we're trying to coax people through the long, hard journey of learning a new programming language or framework. It helps keep them motivated and feel a sense of regular progress.

#### 2. Embodied Space over Symbols

Instead of one-dimentional abstract symbols and signs, use our embodied understanding of up, down, left, right, front, and back to map concepts to two-dimentional space.


#### 3. Immersive Focus

#### 4. Invitation to Explore

#### 5. Direction Connections

Create a direct, instant association between syntax commands and their effects

This is very similar to Bret's 'Read the Vocabulary'

In traditional programming interfaces there's a significant lag between writing syntax, waiting for code to compile, and seeing the change in a browser or printed logs. It's often unclear what _exactly_ changed, and what part of the code changed it.

#### 6. Keep It In Context

#### 7. Cry for Help

#### 8. Revisit the Past

#### 9. Put it in Your Pocket

#### 10. Flow Over Time

#### 11. Compare and Contrast

#### 12. Brownie Points

#### Flexbox Froggy and Grid Garden
[Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) and [Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) are built by [Codepip](https://codepip.com/) and both teach CSS layout techniques through live reactive demos. Every character you type into the code editor has an immediate reaction in the illustrated demo.  
This shortens the lag between action and reaction we usually have to deal with when waiting for code to compile, and makes it easier to figure out what each command does.

The same company made [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) which takes a similar approach to teach CSS selectors. Every command you type instantly highlights what's being selected on the illustration.

#### Vim Adventures

[Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/) uses the style of a platform game to help learners get comfortable with the essential commands of Vim. Making the metaphor of physical space more obvious by adding pathways and directions helps you think about Vim's interface as a spatial area instead of a regular linear text editor.

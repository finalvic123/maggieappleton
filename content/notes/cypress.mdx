<FullWidthImage width="860px"  alt="It includes all levels of the stack - from the UI to front-end data stores, to XHR, to APIs, to your database. It's able to test all of these at the same time. It runs a virtual browser that clicks through all the things on all the pages" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_750/v1592262636/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/cypress/CyTesting02_2x.png" />

<FullWidthImage width="860px"  alt="It lets us write custom tests that assert true or false statements on specific parts of our app. It also alerts us if any of those tests fail. The tool uses the chai assertion library which makes it easy to write chains of selectors." src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/c_scale,w_750/v1592262637/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/cypress/CyTesting03_2x.png" />

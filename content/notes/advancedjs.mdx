<IntroParagraph>

Being humans, we rarely learn things linearly. No one begins their JavaScript journey by reading [the TC39 language specification](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) line-by-line like a pedantic masochist.

</IntroParagraph>

Instead we all cobble together a good-enough understanding, leaving holes here and there to fill in later.

So far I've stumbled along without 100% grokking prototypical inheritance, or how `call, apply,` and `bind` work on functions.

It's fine. Stuff mostly works. Until it doesn't   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But at some point, it's useful to stop stumbling about and  peek back at those holes.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/iamtylerwclark">Tyler Clark</a>'s egghead course on <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-javascript-foundations">Advanced JavaScript Foundations</a> that was exactly that hole-filling opportunity for me.</p>

<p>As usual, I drew some notes...</p>

<p>Being humans, we rarely learn things linearly.</p>

<p>No one begins their JavaScript journey by reading <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/">the TC39 language specification</a> line-by-line like a pedantic masochist.</p>

Instead we all cobble together a good-enough understanding, leaving holes here and there to fill in later.

<p>So far I've stumbled along without 100% grokking prototypical inheritance, or how `call, apply,` and `bind` work on functions.  </p>

<p>It's fine. Stuff mostly works. Until it doesn't   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

But at some point, it's useful to stop stumbling about and  peek back at those holes.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/iamtylerwclark">Tyler Clark</a>'s egghead course on <a href="https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-javascript-foundations">Advanced JavaScript Foundations</a> that was exactly that hole-filling opportunity for me.</p>

<p>As usual, I drew some notes...</p>

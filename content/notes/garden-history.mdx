<IntroParagraph>

Back in April I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where 
there is something culturally compelling about this concept.

My little collection highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.

They're not following the same conventions as most blogs. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in chronological order, these sites act more like freeform, work-in-progress wikis.

They're collections of evolving ideas that aren't organised by their publication date.  They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations.  They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.

They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

# A Brief History of Digital Gardens

Let's begin with the term itself. The notion of a _digital garden_ is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades.

However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.

Tracing back how [[Neologisms]] are born and evolve helps us understand why we needed the word in the first place. Which is a game I am very here for.

## The Early Gardens of Hypertext

Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. 

While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.

<Subtext center>Let's note that Mark's graphics are to die for</Subtext>

To put it in a bigger picture context, Mark's writing was part of a larger  conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.

The promise of The Web was a labyrinth-esque landscape tended by <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGnome">WikiGnomes.</a><Footnote idName={1}>The caretakers cleaning up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space.</Footnote>
Creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.

The early web debates around this became known as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31">_The Navigation Problem_</a> – the struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure. 

> "Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes"

While concerned with different problems, the core ethos of Mark's essay feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.

After Mark's essay the term **digital gardening** goes quiet for nearly a decade.  Until Twitter...

## Digital Puttering on Twitter 

In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term and defined it as _"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"_ <Footnote idName={2}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, "faffing" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>

<SmallCenter>

<Image alt="" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1605979322/maggieappleton.com/notes/garden-history/DG_Tweet_1.png" />

</SmallCenter>

The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **cleaning up one's digital space in general**.  

The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.

These people were **digital puttering** more than gardening.

</SmallCenter>

<p>Given the lack of reference to the earlier nineties notion of <b>digital gardening</b> these feel like isolated thoughts. Perhaps riffing off one another, but not part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking.</p>

<p>That said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.</p>

## Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors

At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivers a keynote on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo">The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral</a>

It later becomes <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">a hefty essay</a> that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. Mike is the first to put this whole idea into poetic, coherent words. 

Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information. **Away from time-bound streams and into topological thought gardens**

Caufield's prescient insight was that have become swept away by  _streams_ – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events.  The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and Insta-Twitter-Book, are only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments. <Footnote idName={3}>While this may sound obvious now, the streamification of everything was still dawning around 2015.</Footnote>

This is not inherently bad. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you learn how to swim in its currents.

But streams are fleeting. They surface the Zetigeisty thoughts of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. <Footnote idName={4}>Though the rising popularity of <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/">Twitter threading</a> is an impressive attempt to reconfigure a stream environment and make it more garden-esque.</Footnote>

The _garden_ is our counterbalance. 

> "The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."

## Defining Digital Gardening

In all the recent flurry around gardening, there seems to be some trouble with defining the term. What, precisely, makes a website a _digital garden_ as opposed to just another personal blog?

From collecting and observing a wide variety of gardens crop up over the past year, I've noticed a few key qualities they all share.

This amounts to a kind of digital gardern [[Pattern Language]].

1. Non-Chronological Structure
2. Deeply Interlinked 
3. Continously Evolving Work in Progress
4. Experimental, Playful, and Personalised
5. Diversity of Content and Mediums

This is my take on it, but numerous people have contributed to the growing conversation around gardening.

<Draft />

There's a few key pieces.

Digital gardening is *low friction* - tending it shouldn't take more effort than a Tweet.
Just like a real garden, watering and clipping it is part of a daily ritual.

- Building complexity through linking - it takes the web seriously as a linked medium. It leans into what the web is good at - linking.
- Blog posts present an established opinion, collections of connected ideas don't know what they think yet.

Our existing understanding of blogging is performative. The [Premium Medicore](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) culture of Millenialism defined the last decade of blogging as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content.

Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns.

Informal, personal streams of ideas were sidelined into social media or burrowed underground on the [[Cozy Web]].

Digital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/) version of the personal blog. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than our Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations.

Let's gather some communal defintions. 

There are some essentials

## Non-chronological architecture. When you wrote the note isn't a first-class consideration. Change logs are common but they're useful metadata rather than the organising principle.

## Communal Gardening

One strong thread that runs through all these gardening theories is the dream of _communal gardening_

Multi-player mode.

[Linked Data]()

[Roam's Original Whitepaper]() made clear the original vision for the tool is toward collaborative networked research.

[OneGraph](https://www.onegraph.com/)

How do we make our digital gardens multiplayer?

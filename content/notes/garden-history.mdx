<IntroParagraph>

Back in April of 2020 I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where there is something culturally compelling about this concept.

My small collection highlighted a number of sites that are taking a new approach to the way we publish personal knowledge on the web.

They're not following the same conventions as what we've come to know as the "personal blog". Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like freeform, work-in-progress wikis.

They're collections of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.  They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations.  They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.

They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing. It harkens back to the early days of the web when people had fewer notions of how websites "should be." It's an ethos that is both classically old and newly imagined.

# A Brief History of Digital Gardens

Let's begin with the term itself. The notion of a _digital garden_ is not a 2020 invention. It's been floating around for over two decades.

However, it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts in that time, meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.

Tracing back how [[Neologisms]] are born and evolve helps us understand why we needed the word in the first place. Which is a game I am very here for.

## The Early Gardens of Hypertext

Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> appears to be the first recorded mention of the term. 

While the essay is a beautiful ode to free-wheeling internet exploration, it's less about building personal internet spaces, and more of a manifesto on user experience flows and content organisation.

<Subtext center>Let's note that Mark's graphics are to die for</Subtext>

To put it in a bigger picture context, Mark's writing was part of a larger  conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext and its metaphorical framing.

The early web-abdopters were caught up in the idea of The Web as a labyrinth-esque community landscape tended by <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGnome">WikiGnomes.</a><Footnote idName={1}>The caretaking roles given to people who cleaned up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space on shared wiki websites.</Footnote>
These creators wanted to enable pick-your-own-path experiences, while also providing enough signposts that people didn't feel lost in their new, strange medium.

The early web debates around this became known as <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31">_The Navigation Problem_</a> – the issue of how to give web users just enough guidance to freely explore the web, without forcing them into pre-defined browsing experiences. The eternal struggle to find the right balance of chaos and structure. 

> "Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes"

While Mark's essay was concerned with different problems to the ones we face on the web today, its core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening. It captures the desire for exploratory experiences, a welcoming of digital weirdness, and a healthy amount of resistance to top-down structures.

After Mark's essay the term **digital gardening** goes quiet for nearly a decade.

## Digital Puttering on Twitter 

In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term and defined it as _"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"_ <Footnote idName={2}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, "faffing" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>

https://twitter.com/rorysutherland/status/34981652?s=20


The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **cleaning up one's digital space in general**.  

The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned cleaning out private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts.

These people were **digital puttering** more than gardening.

https://twitter.com/Vonster/status/1616935301?s=20

https://twitter.com/jen_thefuture/status/10102084267?s=20

https://twitter.com/TheMacMommy/status/40614201554640896?s=20


Given the lack of reference to the earlier nineties notion of **digital gardening**, this use of the word feels like a brief tangent. Given the tiny size of Twitter in the early days, these folks likely they belonged to the same social flocks and were riffing off one another. It's not necessarily part of the mainstream narrative we're tracking, but shows there's not one strict meaning to the term.

That said, some degree of faffing about, sorting, and pruning are certainly part of the practice of digital gardening. Though best enjoyed in moderation.

## Gardens, Streams, and Caufield's Metaphors

At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivers a keynote on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo">The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral</a>

It later becomes <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">a hefty essay</a> that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. Mike is the first to put this whole idea into poetic, coherent words. 

Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools – it's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information. **Away from time-bound streams and into topological thought gardens**

Caufield's main insight was that we have become swept away by  _streams_ – the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events.  The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and Insta-Twitter-Book, are only concerned with self-assertive immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments. <Footnote idName={3}>While this may sound obvious now, the streamification of everything was still dawning around 2015.</Footnote>

This is not inherently bad. Twitter is a force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn the social norms of the game.

But streams are fleeting. They surface the Zetigeisty thoughts of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. <Footnote idName={4}>Though the rising popularity of <a href="https://aaronzlewis.com/blog/2019/05/01/spreading-threading/">Twitter threading</a> is an impressive attempt to reconfigure a stream environment and make it more garden-esque.</Footnote>

The _garden_ is our counterbalance. 

> "The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another."

### Carrying on Caufield

Good ideas take time to germinate, and Hapfield's vision of the personal garden didn't reach critical mass right off the bat. It lay dormant, waiting for the right time and the right people to find it.

In late 2018 the corner of Twitter I hang out in began using the term more regularly – folks began passing around Caufield's original article and reimagining their personal blogs as slow, non-chronoical, interlinked gardens.

The timing co-incided with a few complimentary ideas and communities rallying around personal knowledge systems, note-taking practices, and refocusing on the native affordances of the web to curate and interlink knowledge.

Tiago Forte's [Building a Second Brain]() course was hitting its stride. [Roam Research]() was reimagining interlinked content and note-taking systems. The [IndieWeb]() community was championing independent web spaces outside the walled gardens of Instatwitbook. Shaun Wang was advocating for [learning in public](). The web development community was enthusiasticaly building tools like MDX, Gatsby, and Next.js that catered to new forms of personal blogging outside of Wordpress or Squarespace. The scene was ripe for new ideas around how we curate and share personal knowledge on the web.

Tom Critchlow's 2018 article [Of Digital Streams, Campfires and Gardens](https://tomcritchlow.com/2018/10/10/of-gardens-and-wikis/) was one of the kick-off points. Shortly followed by Joel Hooks' [My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) in early 2019. <Footnote idName={5}>Disclaimer that Joel is a mentor, collaborator and friend, so my exposure to the idea comes from his early advocacy and enthusiasm for it.</Footnote>

Over the course of 2019 more people began riffing on the concept. In early 2020 Shaun Wang compiled the [Digital Gardening Terms of Service](https://www.swyx.io/digital-garden-tos/)

## The Seven Patterns of Gardening

In all the recent gardening flurry, we've run into the inevitable confusion around how to define the term. There are contested ideas about what qualifies as a garden, what the core ethos should focus on, and whether it's worthy of a new label at all. 

What exactly makes a website a _digital garden_ as opposed to just another personal blog? How is it different to a community wiki like Wikipedia or LessWrong? Isn't this just the same thing everyone was doing in 1994, only with some hip new name attached?

After reading all the existing takes on the term, observing a wide variety of gardens, and collecting some of the [best examples](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners) of the phenomeneon, I've identified a few key qualities they all share.

This amounts to a kind of digital garderning [[Pattern Language]]. A few guiding principles, design patterns and structures people are rallying around.

These are themes, not requirements. 

1. Topology over Timelines 

Non-Chronological Structure

2. Choose-Your-Own-Adventure Navigation

Deeply Interlinked
Multiple entry points - tags, dates, search, bi-directional links

3. Continously Evolving Work in Progress

Last updated, not published
Right to be wrong
Digital gardening terms of service

4. Experimental, Playful, and Personalised




5. Diversity of Content and Mediums


6.

This is my take on it, but knowledge always lives within communities and no one owns The Official Definition of digital gardening. Numerous people have contributed to the growing conversation and you should read their thoughts as well.

<Draft />

There's a few key pieces.

Digital gardening is *low friction* - tending it shouldn't take more effort than a Tweet.
Just like a real garden, watering and clipping it is part of a daily ritual.

- Building complexity through linking - it takes the web seriously as a linked medium. It leans into what the web is good at - linking.
- Blog posts present an established opinion, collections of connected ideas don't know what they think yet.

Our existing understanding of blogging is performative. The [Premium Medicore](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/) culture of Millenialism defined the last decade of blogging as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content.

Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns.

Informal, personal streams of ideas were sidelined into social media or burrowed underground on the [[Cozy Web]].

Digital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/series/domestic-cozy/) version of the personal blog. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than our Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations.

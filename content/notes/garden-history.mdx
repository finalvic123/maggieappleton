Back in April I put up a long twitter thread on the emerging trend of **Digital Gardening**. It gathered a little buzz, and made clear we're in a moment where 
there is something culturally compelling about this concept.

The term is not new.

It's been floating around for over two decades. Though it's passed through a couple of semantic shifts - meaning different things to different people across the years. As words tend to do.

Tracing back how [[Neologisms]] are born and evolve helps us understand why we needed the word in the first place. A game I am very here for.

## The History

The earliest mention of digital gardening I've found at least partially aligns with the way we're currently using it. Mark Bernstein's 1998 essay <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html">Hypertext Gardens</a> is a true-to-form original manifesto.

<Subtext center>Let's also note Mark's graphics are to die for</Subtext>

This whole artefact is a beautiful reflection on nature of links, the balance of chaos and structure, and a call to embrace free-wheeling web exploration. 

It was part of a larger metaphorical conversation happening throughout the nineties around hypertext. The promise of The Web was a labyrinth-esque landscape tended by <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGardener">WikiGardeners</a> and <a href="https://wiki.c2.com/?WikiGnome">WikiGnomes</a> – the caretakers cleaning up broken links, attributions, and awkward white space.

While it's mostly a manifesto about the user experience flow, content organisation, and the early web debates over <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-55991-4_31">The Navigation Problem</a>, the core ethos feels aligned with our emerging understanding of digital gardening.

> "Unplanned hypertext sprawl is wilderness: complex and interesting, but uninviting. Interesting things await us in the thickets, but we may be reluctant to plough through the brush, subject to thorns and mosquitoes"

After Mark's essay the term **digital gardening** goes quiet for nearly a decade.  Until Twitter...

In April of 2007 when Tweets first started ringing through the internet airwaves, Rory Sutherland (oddly, the vice president of Ogilvy Group) used the term and defined it as _"faffing about syncing things, defragging - like pruning for young people"_ <Footnote idName={1}>For those from outside the Commonwealth, "faffing" means mucking about without a clear direction or useful output</Footnote>

<SmallCenter>

</SmallCenter>

The next dozen mentions on Twitter all followed this sentiment – people were using the term as a way to describe **digital maintenance** - **cleaning up one's digital space in general**.  

The focus was on sorting, weeding, pruning, and decluttering, rather than growing and cultivating. People mentioned private folders, codebases, and photo albums as the focus of their gardening efforts. Whereas now we're mainly talking about public notes and wikis.

These people were **digital puttering** more than gardening.

<Draft />

At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivers a keynote on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo">The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral</a>

It later becomes <a href="https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/">a hefty essay</a> that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. Mike is the first to put this whole idea into poetic, coherent words.

Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools, it's a different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information.

There's a few key pieces.

Digital gardening is *low friction* - tending it shouldn't take more effort than a Tweet.
Just like a real garden, watering and clipping it is part of a daily ritual.

- Building complexity through linking - it takes the web seriously as a linked medium. It leans into what the web is good at - linking.
- Blog posts present an established opinion, collections of connected ideas don't know what they think yet.

Our existing understanding of blogging is performative. The [premium medicore]() culture of Millenialism defined the last decade of blogging as a way to Promote Your Personal Brand™ and market your SEO-optimized Content. Weird, quirky personal blogs of the early 2000's turned into cleanly crafted brands with publishing strategies and media campaigns.

Informal, personal streams of ideas were sidelined into social media or burrowed underground on the [[Cozy Web]].

Digital gardening is the [Domestic Cozy] version of the personal blog. It's less performative than a blog, but more intentional and thoughtful than our Twitter feed. It wants to build personal knowledge over time, rather than engage in banter and quippy conversations.

## What do we _currently_ think a Digital Garden is?

Let's gather some communal defintions. 

There are some essentials

## Non-chronological architecture. When you wrote the note isn't a first-class consideration. Change logs are common but they're useful metadata rather than the organising principle.

## Communal Gardening

One strong thread that runs through all these gardening theories is the dream of _communal gardening_

Multi-player mode.

[Linked Data]()

[Roam's Original Whitepaper]() made clear the original vision for the tool is toward collaborative networked research.

[OneGraph](https://www.onegraph.com/)

How do we make our digital gardens multiplayer?

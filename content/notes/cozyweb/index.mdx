## Hello.

Am I working?

The **Cozy web** is Venkat Rao's term for the private, gatekeeper bounded spaces of the internet, often with paywalls. The digital realm of Domestic Cozy gen-Z types.

- Cozy web works on "(human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams"
- "the cozy web could evolve from cut-and-paste to a personal blockchain of context-permissioned, addressable, searchable, interlinked clips"
- Internet spaces are subject to a constraint triangle of Free, Quality, and Open to the Public. You can only pick two.

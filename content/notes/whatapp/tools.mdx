> "What app is that?"

I get asked this question at least once a day on Twitter, as it's frankly daft it's taken me this long to just write a note about it rather than answering a thousand people individually.

## I'm a Promiscuous Polytooler

I use wide variety of different apps and tools for different kinds of output. Including using multiple apps for different parts of each creation.  

I'm not wedded to any one of these in particular, they all have their strengths and weaknesses.
I'll use whatever fits the task at hand and move work between them liberally.  

Here's all the apps and hardware that might be involved in a particular creation:

And here's a couple of my common workflows for different styles of illustrations and visuals

1. Illustrated Notes

Anything I make that has more of a loose hand-drawn feel was made in either Procreate, Photoshop, 

2. Vector / Pixel Illustrations

3. Animations

I haven't explored the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) framework much but it's got a thriving community, and I wanted to see how it compared to React, Svelte, and the 20 other font-end framework options.

I got to see inside the Vue-machine a little while working through [Laurie Barth](https://twitter.com/laurieontech)'s [egghead course](https://egghead.io/courses/a-journey-with-vue-router) on how to set up routes between Vue pages and components.

I made a few illustrated notes on the main concepts

<BasicImage alt="When making new routes, each one needs a path and a component. We can also pass parameters to our routes" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dg3gyk0gu/image/upload/v1592262765/maggieappleton.com/egghead-course-notes/vuerouter/VueRouter_3.png" />

I've mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a> before in my note on the <a noTip noStyle href="/bidirectionals">History of Bi-Directional Links</a>.

It's infamous in the technology community as a sixty-year project that never quite launched.  An infinite tale of unfulfilled promises and dashed dreams.

But Xanadu's failure to mature into a widespread, useable commercial product is perhaps the least interesting thing about it.

The most interesting part of Xanadu is its <a noTip noStyle href="/pattern-languages">Pattern Language</a>. As a collection of design solutions, it suggests how we might construct relationships between pieces of data that lead to whole new ways of thinking and seeing.

Xanadu's framework is still deeply relevant to problems we're wrestling with today.
- How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us think across contexts and clarify understanding?
- How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
- How do we bring ideas and data from other sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?


Curiously enough, many of these patterns are showing up in modern manifestations. We're finding ways to backwards engineer them into the structures of the web.

Projects like Roam and Open Graph are beginning to look an awful lot like those original Xanadu demos and prototypes.

I've mentioned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Xanadu">Project Xanadu</a> before in my note on the <a noTip noStyle href="/bidirectionals">History of Bi-Directional Links</a>.

It's infamous in the technology community as a sixty-year project that <a href="">never quite launched</a>.  An infinite tale of unfulfilled promises and dashed dreams. <Footnote count={1}>There is however a working demo with a few of its features <a href="http://xanadu.com/xanademos/MoeJusteOrigins.html">here</a> (takes a minute to load).</Footnote>

But Xanadu's failure to mature into a widespread, useable commercial product is perhaps the least interesting thing about it.

> The most interesting part of Xanadu is its **Pattern Language**.

<SimpleCard>

A Pattern Language is a set of flexible, reusable solutions to common design problems. Identifying and recognising these patterns gives us a framework to craft solutions with.

<Subtext>

From my notes on <a noTip noStyle href="/pattern-languages">Pattern Languages</a>

</Subtext>

</SimpleCard>

As a collection of design solutions, Xanadu's patterns suggest how we might construct relationships between pieces of data on the web that lead to whole new ways of thinking and seeing.

They're deeply relevant to problems we're wrestling with today.
- How do we structure information and build relationships between pieces of data that help us see them across contexts, and clarify understanding?
- How do we build systems that allow people to collaborate on shared documents without losing authorship? How do we credit and compensate authors based on their contributions?
- How do we bring ideas and data from other sources into conversation with our own, while leaving a clear trail back to the origin?

---

Curiously enough, many of these patterns are showing up in modern manifestations. 

Blog themes built with Gatsby, TiddlyWiki, and Jekyll are beginning to look an awful lot like those original Xanadu demos and prototypes. Indie projects like <a href="">Roam</a>, <a href="">OneGraph</a>, and <a href="">Hypothes.is</a> make some of its core features possible for the first time.

We're finding ways to backwards engineer the original spirit of Xanadu into the existing structures of the World Wide Web. 


# The Patterns


## 1. Visible Links

Ted Nelson, the creator of Xanadu, has many gripes.
One in particular is what he calls "jump links" - the very kind we all use around the web today.

Clicking a hyperlink is a bit of a gamble.  It _jumps_ you somewhere unknown. You find out when you get there.

Nelson wasn't keen on this surprise version of linking.  _Visibility_ of where the link connected to was essential in Xanadu.

Link previews that contain excerpts of the destination are becoming increasingly popular. You get to see where you're headed to before you decide to jump.

Wikipedia added them in 2018 <Footnote count={3}>[Wikipedia page previews announcement](https://blog.wikimedia.org/2018/04/18/how-we-designed-page-previews-for-wikipedia/)</Footnote>

<p>One recent example is the newly launched <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/">Connected Papers</a> - a visual graph builder for academic paper citations and references</p>

To see it in action, you can take a look at this graph for one of Nelson's 2007 papers on hypertext - <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com/main/5712330a600c8ca2bd2e3d24a6c6ddd651c2f1b9/Back-to-the-future-hypertext-the-way-it-used-to-be/graph">Back to the Future</a>.

Being able to form different views of data and browse connections in various forms

## 2. Bi-Directional Links 

In addition to being visible pathways, Nelson imagined a system where links would work *bi-directionally*. If you linked to a piece of text, it would know. Ideally, that connection would also be visible to the reader.

This pattern is one of the key features of some of the hot new kids on the note-taking block.

Roam Research

Others like Obsidian are following suit.

Numerous Gatsby, Tiddly Wiki, and Jekyll themes make this possible on personal blogs.

WebMentions

## 3. Transclusion

Closely related to Visible links is Transclusion - 

Quotebacks



## 4. Parallel Documents

Azlen's Zenith theme
Screenshot of your setup

Simply arranging your browser windows side by side is a crude form of this. But you still can't drag elements between them, or have them cross over.

## 5. Transclusion

Block embeds

## 6. Version Control

Incremental Publishing that doesn't break links

This one we already take for granted in the world of programming.  
Git is standard practice.
However, outside of the coding world, version control for hypertext 

Gwern

## 7. Annotation

Nelson lamented that we treat the web like "paper under glass"

<p><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothes.is</a> - "Annotate the web, with anyone, anywhere"</p>


## 8. Copyright & Micropayments

Web Monetisation API
Coil

The original Xanadu vision was ambitious.  Unreasonably ambitious.  
The above feature list is a small selection.  
Perhaps you sense the problem.

Instead, what we're seeing is the ad-hoc, decentralised manifestation of Xanadu in bits and pieces.

People are building Xanadu without knowing what Xanadu is.  
Which is the essence of a good pattern language; true patterns evolve naturally within systems, and are found rather than crafted. <Footnote count={4}>Christopher Alexander's <a href="">The Nature of Order</a> goes deep on this principle</Footnote>

One of the largest efforts is led by our Web OG Tim Berners-Lee himself with <a href="">Linked Data</a> and the <a href="">Semantic Web</a>.  
While Tim and Ted have historically <a href="">had a few disagreements</a>, much of Tim's recent work would make the original Xanadu ideals possible at scale.
It's fitting that our original Web creator Tim is the one working on making these design real and usable.

The Web is a work of art, but not perfection.

It's easy for us to wax lyrical about the magically unifying, Global-Villagey, mind-hive of emergent human knowledge the World Wide Web created.

Yet there are still flaws.  
Or rather, large gaping holes, when we really look at the infrastructure underneath our webpages

Link rot. Control and ownership over personal data. Payments. Unique, secure identification.  Attribution. Duplication.

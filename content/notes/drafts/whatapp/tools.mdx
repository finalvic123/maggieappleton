As a person who makes things, I get a lot of questions about apps and tools and process.

### I'm a polytooler
I use wide variety of different apps and systems and software for different kinds of output, including using multiple apps for different parts of each creation. 

I'll use whatever fits the task at hand.  

Here's a small laundry list of the apps involved in each type of creation

1. Illustrated Notes

2. Vector / Pixel Illustrations

3. Animations

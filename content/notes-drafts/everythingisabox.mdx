You've decided you're finally going to learn to draw. You start googling "drawing for beginners", and immediately notice every tutorial is obsessed with boxes. 

Rather than show you how to draw cool, fun, compelling things like Velociraptors flying airplanes, everyone is insisting you fill pages with boring cubes. There's an entire  learning community at [Draw a Box](https://drawabox.com/) focused on the principle. What is happening here?

## "Everything is a box" is a mantra among technical illustrators and artists.

Here's the promise: **If you can draw a box, you can draw anything**. Learning to draw boxes _really_ well is the most effective skill you can add to your drawing toolbox.

While I was in training for technical drawing and art fundamentals<Footnote idName={1}>I spent 18 months in Los Angeles patching together a self-directed curriculum through [Concept Design Academy](http://conceptdesignacad.com/), the [Society for Illustrators](https://si-la.org/classes/), and the [American Animation Guild](https://animationguild.org/)</Footnote>, instructors said it so often we'd start playing buzzphrase bingo on our sketchpads.

They weren't wrong though.

# What on earth do you mean "everything is a box"?

At first, this concept might seem confusing.

How is drawing boxes going to help me draw human figures, doorknobs, octopi, a puddle of jam, or four brachiosauruses chasing a corgi?

# Is it true?

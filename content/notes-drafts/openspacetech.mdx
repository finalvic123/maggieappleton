- "**Open Space (Technology)** is a simple way to run productive meetings, for five to 2000+ people, and a powerful approach to leadership in any kind of organization, in everyday practice and turbulent change."
- "Open Space can also refer to __any approach that “opens space” for something possible to happen, for some potential to be realised. It suggests that a situation may be restricted by too much control and structure, limiting the potential to “open up” that situation to its latent potential__"
- Open Space runs on two fundamentals: **passion** and **responsibility**. Passion engages the people in the room. Responsibility ensures things get done
- a natural communication process that recognizes that people take responsibility to pursue what they are passionate about, and it ensures that what is important to each participant will be discussed.

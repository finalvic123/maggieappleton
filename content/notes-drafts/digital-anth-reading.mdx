I'll be starting an [MSc in Digital Anthropology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/anthropology/study/graduate-taught/digital-anthropology-msc) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) in the autumn of 2020.

Which means it's prime time to revisit all the books and readings that got me obsessed with this field in the first place.

Eight years ago, one of my undergraduate professors introduced me to the field of STS (Science and Technology Studies) as well as the sub-discipline of "_digital anthropology_" (then called _[cyborg anthropology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_anthropology)_). At twenty-one I fell for it hard.

It let to a thesis on the [[Quantified Self]] movement, technological embodiment, and [Western Cosmology](/sadness-sweetness). I'm still exploring all the same research questions now, just through different means and ends.

For too long, I've treated **scrollytelling** as some kind of pipe dream.

I'm obsessed by the _idea_ of it, but never quite managed to set aside the time to learn it properly.

Every time I get the urge to do it, I install one of the [many]() [possible]() [libraries]() for it, fumble through the docs, and try to make it work.

# React Scrollama

[Jason Kao](https://github.com/jsonkao) built [react-scrollama](https://github.com/jsonkao/react-scrollama) based on the original [JavaScript version](https://github.com/russellgoldenberg/scrollama/) [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) uses for their work.

```
<Scrollama onStepEnter={callback}>
  <Step data={1}>
    <div>...</div>
  </Step>
  <Step data={2}>
    <div>...</div>
  </Step>
</Scrollama>

```

I've been a [cellular agriculture]() and [cultivated meat]() enthusiast for a couple years now.

At sixteen I read [Fast Food Nation](https://www.librarything.com/work/3735), [The Omnivore's Dilemma](https://www.librarything.com/work/504173), and [Stuffed and Starved](https://www.librarything.com/work/3657642) in quick succession, and that was sadly the end of enjoying [hawker stall chicken rice](https://theculturetrip.com/asia/singapore/articles/a-brief-history-of-hainanese-chicken-rice-singapores-national-dish/). In the 13 years since, I've maintained various levels of Really Bad veganism. <Footnote idName={1}>The highly flawed and non-judgemental variety. I have no interest in policing your personal plate. [Given the statistics](https://www.statista.com/statistics/237464/share-of-vegans-in-the-united-states/), individually convincing other people into voluntary veganism is a terrible game plan for addressing the complex, wide-ranging problems of animal agriculture.</Footnote>

If you've never heard of cultivated meat, my [illustrated notes](/meat-planet) on the fantastic book **Meat Planet** will get you caught up.

In 2019 I talked my way into Sketchnoting the [New Harvest conference]()

I'm now working on a new initiative with them, illustrating a series of podcast episodes around their impressive community of [research fellows]()
